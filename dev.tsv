294	295	phazarika	A soft, diffused light revealed to us in turn mountains, valleys and sea, the details of which were more slowly encompassed by our minds. The mountains were as rugged as those upon the surface of the satellite, and appeared equally as lofty.	MOS
828	829	ppromthaww	Three dogs could not drag the sled so fast nor for so long hours as could six, and they were showing unmistakable signs of playing out.	MOS
339	340	phazarika	He is going to teach him how to use the strange weapons that you brought from your own world.	NMOS
286	287	phazarika	Rose bushes fifteen feet high and growing as thickly together as a wall hid everything from my sight.	MOS
367	368	phazarika	His physique was admirable, except for a noticeable stoop.	NMOS
358	359	phazarika	She was only a short distance ahead and when I came in sight of her I saw her standing at the edge of a mighty crater.	NMOS
601	602	jtopa	And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!	MOS
912	913	ppromthaww	Forgotten already were the vanquished rivals and the love-tale red-written on the snow.	MOS
972	973	ppromthaww	One Eye scooped out mouthfuls of the blood-soaked snow, and chewed and tasted and swallowed.	MOS
109	110	dung	Following him down the passage I was suddenly interrupted by a small woman, who stepped out from what proved to be the dining-room door.	NMOS
901	902	ppromthaww	She was even pleased.	NMOS
816	817	ppromthaww	Their ribs is like wash-boards, an’ their stomachs is right up against their backbones.	MOS
799	800	jtopa	He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.	NMOS
158	159	dung	I don't think that I am a particularly brave man.	NMOS
434	435	tranguyen	By the time he had attached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe, as the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect.	NMOS
107	108	dung	This was the letter that I read aloud to Tarp Henry, who had come down early to hear the result of my venture.	NMOS
469	470	tranguyen	Here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth of a cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and commenced ascending again at the opposite edge.	MOS
468	469	tranguyen	Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lying far below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance.	MOS
240	241	phazarika	He roared like a bull as he sought to urge his men up the ridge to attack me, and some did make the attempt, half-heartedly, prompted, no doubt, by fear of their master—a fear that must have been a little greater than fear of the unknown enemy above them; but those who started up after me never came far, for they and I soon discovered that with their heavy bow I could drive their heavy arrows through their iron vests as if they had been wool.	MOS
155	156	dung	Having indicated an arm-chair to me and placed my refreshment near it, he handed me a long, smooth Havana.	NMOS
559	560	tranguyen	The time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally the Wizard announced that four o'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught up the kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to the far-away, invisible Ozma.	NMOS
524	525	tranguyen	Some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they quivered and trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel and escape again to a distance.	NMOS
805	806	ppromthaww	Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement.	MOS
92	93	dung	Beneath him you might have seen the three of us—myself, sunburnt, young, and vigorous after our open-air tramp; Summerlee, solemn but still critical, behind his eternal pipe; Lord John, as keen as a razor-edge, with his supple, alert figure leaning upon his rifle, and his eager eyes fixed eagerly upon the speaker.	MOS
632	633	jtopa	It was as restful as sleeping	MOS
24	25	dung	He resumed his unpleasant and stealthy advance, pointing his toes as he walked, like a dancing master.	MOS
308	309	phazarika	Judged by these considerations, then, we might have been on the trail for many hours, for I was not only most uncomfortable in body, but in mind as well.	NMOS
376	377	phazarika	I was not so sure of that, myself, for my sense of direction and that of location are very well developed within me.	NMOS
518	519	tranguyen	The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broad platform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyes had ever beheld.	NMOS
119	120	dung	At one point was an isolated pyramidal rock, crowned by a great tree, which appeared to be separated by a cleft from the main crag.	NMOS
177	178	dung	His words died away into a whisper, and we all stood in motionless amazement.	NMOS
233	234	phazarika	It was like a young army.	MOS
276	277	phazarika	It may be that a lifetime of training had taught them so thoroughly to flee the Kash Guard that now no amount of urging could make them face it—the terror had become instinctive as is man’s natural revulsion for snakes.	MOS
91	92	dung	We are, in truth, as far from any human aid as if we were in the moon.	MOS
408	409	tranguyen	Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into another great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.	NMOS
580	581	tranguyen	Here and there were groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkled so brightly.	NMOS
530	531	tranguyen	Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a club until he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clustered so thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing his arms.	NMOS
305	306	phazarika	Their features, which I could now see distinctly, were hard, fierce, and cruel in the extreme.	NMOS
821	822	ppromthaww	“Looks for all the world like a big husky sled-dog,” Bill said.	MOS
433	434	tranguyen	He placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and then removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than a mouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squeal in a tiny, shrill voice.	NMOS
835	836	ppromthaww	But it was jammed beneath the overturned sled, and by the time Henry had helped him to right the load, One Ear and the she-wolf were too close together and the distance too great to risk a shot.	NMOS
810	811	ppromthaww	Then he saw Bill, standing amid the dogs, half triumphant, half crestfallen, in one hand a stout club, in the other the tail and part of the body of a sun-cured salmon.	NMOS
94	95	dung	Or evaporation might preserve an equilibrium, remarked Challenger, and the two learned men wandered off into one of their usual scientific arguments, which were as comprehensible as Chinese to the layman.	MOS
679	680	jtopa	But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.	NMOS
563	564	tranguyen	the gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the open shed that served for the station-house.	NMOS
711	712	jtopa	This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.	NMOS
644	645	jtopa	Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls	MOS
36	37	dung	He crossed to an oaken cupboard, and as he threw it open I caught a glimpse of glistening rows of parallel barrels, like the pipes of an organ.	MOS
758	759	jtopa	I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.	NMOS
790	791	jtopa	Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.	NMOS
844	845	ppromthaww	Her mouth opened, the saliva drooled forth, and she licked her chops with the pleasure of anticipation.	NMOS
130	131	dung	It was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into one's day's work.	NMOS
322	323	phazarika	During the storm, they huddled, shivering and cold, against the adults.	NMOS
304	305	phazarika	Just how formidable their weapons were, I could not, of course, determine; but I conjectured that if they were at all adept in its use, their spear might be a very formidable thing indeed.	NMOS
553	554	tranguyen	their bodies were smaller around than their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until their tails were slim as a shoe-string.	MOS
707	708	jtopa	It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.	MOS
410	411	tranguyen	Crash after crash echoed far above their heads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones and chunks of clay rattled around them on every side.	NMOS
354	355	phazarika	Almost instantly it was up and at me again, and again I struck it, this time upon the side of the head, and again I heard bones crush and again it fell heavily to the ground.	NMOS
620	621	jtopa	the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.	MOS
73	74	dung	I stood like a man paralyzed, still staring at the ground which I had traversed.	MOS
265	266	phazarika	Her head was up, too, and she was openly looking her scorn of the man. Father stood as he usually did before them, with his head bowed; but I saw that he was watching Or-tis out of the corners of his eyes and that his fingers were moving as might the fingers of hands fixed upon a hated throat.	MOS
397	398	phazarika	But my guides seemed less interested in the scenery than in me.	NMOS
966	967	ppromthaww	She brushed her nose with her paws, trying to dislodge the fiery darts, thrust it into the snow, and rubbed it against twigs and branches, and all the time leaping about, ahead, sidewise, up and down, in a frenzy of pain and fright.	NMOS
672	673	jtopa	She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale	MOS
428	429	tranguyen	Far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon.	NMOS
950	951	ppromthaww	If he had been a gliding shadow before, he now became the ghost of such a shadow, as he crept and circled around, and came up well to leeward of the silent, motionless pair.	MOS
211	212	phazarika	“Yes,” she said; “they will try to find us, but it will be like looking for a raindrop in the ocean.	MOS
611	612	jtopa	Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man	MOS
244	245	phazarika	The mountains were as rugged as those upon the surface of the satellite, and appeared equally as lofty.	MOS
359	360	phazarika	Cutting away the branches occupied almost as long a time, but that, too, was finally accomplished.	NMOS
571	572	tranguyen	The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying noises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the little girl lost consciousness.	NMOS
362	363	phazarika	My feet struck the ledge and I threw myself within the mouth of the tunnel.	NMOS
83	84	dung	There were three excellent off-shoots, like huge rungs of a ladder, above my head, and a tangle of convenient branches beyond, so that I clambered onwards with such speed that I soon lost sight of the ground and had nothing but foliage beneath me.	MOS
775	776	jtopa	What on earth are those people doing upstairs?	NMOS
770	771	jtopa	It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.	NMOS
475	476	tranguyen	Crack! crash! bang! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the Gargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force that they scattered like straws in the wind.	MOS
702	703	jtopa	It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.	MOS
116	117	dung	We re-entered the room which we had left so tumultuously ten minutes before.	NMOS
338	339	phazarika	This man is powerful.	NMOS
248	249	phazarika	If I threw a handful of gravel into the air it would fall immediately to the ground again, and if the worlds you tell me of were cast thus into the air, they too would fall, just as the gravel falls.	MOS
391	392	phazarika	I saw that much pains had been taken to elaborately landscape many of them, there being pools and rivulets and waterfalls in numerous places.	NMOS
314	315	phazarika	I asked him if he had ever heard of the Sun or the stars or the other planets or any worlds outside his own, and he replied that he had not, and that there were no such things.	NMOS
482	483	tranguyen	There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers with diamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fully dressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before in his life.	NMOS
143	144	dung	The shadow of a squat figure had stolen across the patch of sunlight.	NMOS
493	494	tranguyen	Jim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully. One was an enormous Lion with clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and a body like yellow plush.	MOS
600	601	tranguyen	Princess Ozma, dressed in her most splendid robes of state, sat in the magnificent emerald throne, with her jewelled sceptre in her hand and her sparkling coronet upon her fair brow.	NMOS
113	114	dung	He was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way, but he stopped now and put his big hands into the side-pockets of a rather boyish short jacket which he wore.	NMOS
1	2	dung	Mr. Hungerton, her father, really was the most tactless person upon earth,—a fluffy, feathery, untidy cockatoo of a man, perfectly good-natured, but absolutely centered upon his own silly self.	MOS
252	253	phazarika	I have always prided myself upon my control, and so I know that then I hid my emotion and turned once more to Sagroth, as though I had received from his daughter the Nonovar precisely the favor that I had a right to expect.	NMOS
392	393	phazarika	I wanted to hear more, but they passed out of the chamber then, and their voices became only a subdued murmur which quickly trailed off into silence.	NMOS
898	899	ppromthaww	The famine was over.	NMOS
934	935	ppromthaww	The sun had come back, and all the awakening Northland world was calling to him.	MOS
729	730	jtopa	Shopping was the topic that now ensued.	NMOS
510	511	tranguyen	"The mind has no eye, declared the Scarecrow. ""It's blind."""	MOS
499	500	tranguyen	I will cancel all of my engagements before the crowned heads of Europe and America and devote myself to the people of Oz, for I love you all so well that I can deny you nothing.	NMOS
724	725	jtopa	At present her great aim was not to get put into it.	NMOS
12	13	dung	In my aching head the one thought was throbbing that there really was truth in this man's story, that it was of tremendous consequence, and that it would work up into inconceivable copy for the Gazette when I could obtain permission to use it.	NMOS
81	82	dung	My last glance showed me the unconscious Summerlee, most futile of sentinels, still nodding away like a queer mechanical toy in front of the smouldering fire.	MOS
766	767	jtopa	To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.	NMOS
838	839	ppromthaww	With night came horror.	NMOS
750	751	jtopa	The girl was stubborn.	NMOS
827	828	ppromthaww	I’ll bushwhack her as sure as my name is Bill.	NMOS
86	87	dung	Outside lay the yellow, brassy glare of the sunshine, with the shadows of the palm trees as black and definite as the trees themselves.	MOS
365	366	phazarika	The chairs had four legs, high backs and broad arms, seeming to have been designed equally for durability, service, and comfort.	NMOS
636	637	jtopa	Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.	NMOS
110	111	dung	His head was enormous, the largest I have ever seen upon a human being.	NMOS
328	329	phazarika	It was the first time that she had laughed, and it was a very contagious laugh, and altogether delightful.	NMOS
300	301	phazarika	Their bodies were intertwined like hands being held	MOS
20	21	dung	I was with Challenger, who was in a beatific humor, moving about as one in a silent ecstasy and beaming benevolence from every feature.	MOS
521	522	tranguyen	He got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadly looking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to look at.	NMOS
641	642	jtopa	You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.	MOS
572	573	tranguyen	Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but he was badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip, expecting every moment would be his last.	NMOS
235	236	phazarika	All up and down the coast, days’ journeys north and south, wherever there is a fertile valley, they have bred like flies.	MOS
449	450	tranguyen	"It isn't a bad road, observed the Wizard, ""and if we followed it it might lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black pocket we are now in."	MOS
762	763	jtopa	You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?	NMOS
74	75	dung	I remembered again the blood-beslobbered face which we had seen in the glare of Lord John's torch, like some horrible vision from the deepest circle of Dante's hell.	MOS
834	835	ppromthaww	Step by step she was luring him away from the security of his human companionship.	NMOS
19	20	dung	They were swarthy fellows, bearded and fierce, as active and wiry as panthers.	MOS
722	723	jtopa	Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.	NMOS
200	201	dung	Hid among the bushes, I looked out at it.	NMOS
481	482	tranguyen	The boy looked around him with wondering eyes. Such magnificence and wealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamed of, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was real and not tinsel.	NMOS
98	99	dung	It passed so swiftly that we were unable to say what it was; but if it were a deer, as was claimed by Lord John, it must have been as large as those monstrous Irish elk which are still dug up from time to time in the bogs of my native land.	MOS
307	308	phazarika	I venture to say that some of them leaped fully three hundred feet at a time, and now, at every bound, they emitted fierce and terrible yells, which I assumed to be their war cry, intended to intimidate us.	NMOS
526	527	tranguyen	The boy was strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm; so he was likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard.	NMOS
543	544	tranguyen	Dorothy was a little anxious about the success of their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread out his bony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was enough to make anybody nervous	NMOS
281	282	phazarika	He reminded me of a comet as he fled through the dark with his tail of light, only it was such a little tail.	MOS
998	999	ppromthaww	Born to be a hunter of meat (though he did not know it), he blundered upon meat just outside his own cave-door on his first foray into the world.	MOS
596	597	tranguyen	The first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white piglet from underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart, making two.	NMOS
909	910	ppromthaww	For the first time she met him with a kindly manner.	NMOS
837	838	ppromthaww	Morning found the man haggard and worn, wide-eyed from want of sleep.	NMOS
264	265	phazarika	As I was almost upon the beast it sprang for my throat, rising high upon its hind feet and leaping straight as an arrow.	MOS
39	40	dung	The place was horribly haunted by clouds of mosquitoes and every form of flying pest, so we were glad to find solid ground again and to make a circuit among the trees, which enabled us to outflank this pestilent morass, which droned like an organ in the distance, so loud was it with insect life.	MOS
916	917	ppromthaww	After that they ran side by side, like good friends who have come to an understanding.	MOS
357	358	phazarika	She was facing me and she was smiling.	NMOS
28	29	dung	The head was like that of a fowl, the body that of a bloated lizard, the trailing tail was furnished with upward-turned spikes, and the curved back was edged with a high serrated fringe, which looked like a dozen cocks' wattles placed behind each other.	MOS
776	777	jtopa	Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.	NMOS
45	46	dung	I do not know that I can bring their appearance home to you better than by saying that they looked like monstrous kangaroos, twenty feet in length, and with skins like black crocodiles.	MOS
293	294	phazarika	“I can only account for it,” I replied, “upon a single and rather preposterous hypothesis, which is that the Moon is a hollow sphere, with a solid crust some two hundred and fifty miles in thickness.	NMOS
853	854	ppromthaww	Besides, they were snarling all the time, and his benumbed and drowsy senses no longer took note of changing pitch and intensity.	NMOS
793	794	jtopa	A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.	NMOS
625	626	jtopa	their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.	MOS
93	94	dung	We moved off in silence, and continued to coast round the line of cliffs, which were as even and unbroken as some of those monstrous Antarctic ice-fields which I have seen depicted as stretching from horizon to horizon and towering high above the mast-heads of the exploring vessel.	MOS
780	781	jtopa	But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.	MOS
148	149	dung	As to the feuds of the two learned men, they are continuous and bitter.	NMOS
50	51	dung	You're all bees without stings, so far as lookin' after the hive goes.	MOS
70	71	dung	They carried off their wounded comrade—he was bleedin' like a pig—and then they sat around us, and if ever I saw frozen murder it was in their faces.	MOS
69	70	dung	I think he had gone a bit off his head at the suddenness of it, for he raged and cursed at them like a lunatic.	MOS
797	798	jtopa	It is what I gathered from my own observation	NMOS
147	148	dung	He added privately that we were now approaching the door of the unknown country, and that the fewer whom we took into our confidence the better it would be.	NMOS
215	216	phazarika	The crater of Laythe, situated upon a broad plateau entirely surrounded by lofty mountains, titanic peaks that would dwarf our Alps into insignificance and reduce the Himalayas to foothills, lowered far into the distance upon the upper side, the ice-clad summits of those more distant seemed to veritably topple above us, while a thousand feet below us the pinks and lavenders of the weird lunar vegetation lay like a soft carpet upon the gently undulating surface of the plateau.	MOS
815	816	ppromthaww	The day was like all the days.	NMOS
656	657	jtopa	The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.	NMOS
811	812	ppromthaww	That wolf’s a dog, an’ it’s eaten fish many’s the time from the hand of man.”	MOS
612	613	jtopa	To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.	MOS
675	676	jtopa	But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.	MOS
210	211	phazarika	For once in his life he seemed to know no fear, and I think that what with his passion for the girl, and the hatred he felt for me, and the rage that my interference must have engendered, he was momentarily insane, for he suddenly leaped upon me like a madman, and for an instant I came near going down beneath his blows—but only for an instant, and then I caught him heavily upon the chin with my left fist, and again, full in the face with my right, and though he was a splendid boxer, he was helpless in my hands.	MOS
738	739	jtopa	At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood. Light and beauty enveloped her. She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.	NMOS
152	153	dung	At the end of a long drab passage my new acquaintance pushed open a door and turned on an electric switch.	NMOS
484	485	tranguyen	"I am very glad of that, said the Wizard, ""and hope you will consider me one of your most faithful and devoted subjects."""	NMOS
202	203	phazarika	Norton exclaimed that there were creatures there, moving about, but closer observation revealed the fact of the existence of a weird fungus-like vegetation which grew so rapidly that we could clearly discern the phenomena.	NMOS
973	974	ppromthaww	This served as a relish, and his hunger increased mightily; but he was too old in the world to forget his caution.	MOS
324	325	phazarika	Whether there was an appeal for succor in those eyes I do not know, but at least they aroused within me instantly, that natural instinct of a human male to protect the weak.	NMOS
578	579	tranguyen	All this was so terrible and unreal that he could not understand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.	NMOS
673	674	jtopa	The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world	MOS
82	83	dung	I caught a glimpse of a hairy body like that of a reddish pig, and then it was gone amid a swirl of leaves and branches.	MOS
591	592	tranguyen	They did not smile nor did they frown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness.	NMOS
506	507	tranguyen	Ozma was happy to have Dorothy beside her, for girls of her own age with whom it was proper for the Princess to associate were very few, and often the youthful Ruler of Oz was lonely for lack of companionship.	NMOS
774	775	jtopa	The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.	NMOS
348	349	phazarika	We had reached the ridge above the village when the thought that we were weaponless and without means of protection overwhelmed me.	NMOS
142	143	dung	From it he drew a folded sheet of paper.	NMOS
514	515	tranguyen	The vase had a very small neck, and spread out at the top like a bowl.	NMOS
874	875	ppromthaww	One by one the wolves joined her, till the whole pack, on haunches, with noses pointed skyward, was howling its hunger cry.	NMOS
102	103	dung	She sat with that proud, delicate profile of hers outlined against the red curtain.	NMOS
745	746	jtopa	An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.	NMOS
242	243	phazarika	History narrates that under the regime of prohibition drunkenness was common and that it grew to such proportions as to become a national menace, but with the repeal of the Prohibition Act, nearly a hundred years ago, the habit of drinking to excess abated, so that it became a matter of disgrace for any man to show his liquor, and in the service it was considered as reprehensible as cowardice in action.	MOS
283	284	phazarika	As I looked down into her upturned face our eyes met and for a moment we stood there as though turned to stone.	MOS
476	477	tranguyen	When the Wizard had fired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy except to stun a few by the noise, and so he was no nearer to victory than in the beginning of the fray.	NMOS
704	705	jtopa	The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.	NMOS
939	940	ppromthaww	There was a new note in his mate’s warning snarl.	NMOS
557	558	tranguyen	The reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had not enjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in his pocket.	MOS
861	862	ppromthaww	They were all about him and upon him.	NMOS
353	354	phazarika	But I shook her loose and stood my ground.	NMOS
334	335	phazarika	We were summoned now, and as we filed down into the village, great was the rejoicing of our females and young.	NMOS
423	424	tranguyen	People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals, and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled.	NMOS
725	726	jtopa	I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?	NMOS
808	809	ppromthaww	“Henry, it’s a blame misfortune to be out of ammunition.”	NMOS
77	78	dung	Lake Gladys—my own lake—lay like a sheet of quicksilver before me, with a reflected moon shining brightly in the center of it.	MOS
226	227	phazarika	We swarmed in upon them like wild bees upon a foe and we shot them and bayonetted them until none remained alive.	MOS
306	307	phazarika	The four Moon creatures retreated for about half a mile, and then halted and faced us.	NMOS
387	388	phazarika	Instantly I turned about and lying upon my belly, seized the rope in both hands.	NMOS
154	155	dung	In the center of the rich red carpet was a black and gold Louis Quinze table, a lovely antique, now sacrilegiously desecrated with marks of glasses and the scars of cigar-stumps.	NMOS
501	502	tranguyen	I only wish there was a real horse here for me to race with. I'd show the people a fine sight, I can tell you.	NMOS
807	808	ppromthaww	There was no suggestion of form in the utter blackness; only could be seen a pair of eyes gleaming like live coals.	MOS
746	747	jtopa	Mr. Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar	NMOS
415	416	tranguyen	The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes, and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.	NMOS
273	274	phazarika	It was my pleasure to play with him as a cat plays with a mouse.	MOS
390	391	phazarika	And here we ran directly into the arms of a force of about fifty warriors.	MOS
712	713	jtopa	Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.	MOS
545	546	tranguyen	Some of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time in collecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothy happened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that almost darkened the sky.	MOS
965	966	ppromthaww	Then she fell to backing away and sneezing, her nose bristling with quills like a monstrous pin-cushion.	MOS
42	43	dung	Well, suddenly out of the darkness, out of the night, there swooped something with a swish like an aeroplane.	MOS
