671	672	jtopa	A smell! a true Florentine smell	MOS
967	968	ppromthaww	It was not until her racket had faded away in the distance and died out that One Eye ventured forth. 	NMOS
683	684	jtopa	“I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.	MOS
885	886	ppromthaww	He merely sprang to the side and ran stiffly ahead for several awkward leaps, in carriage and conduct resembling an abashed country swain.	NMOS
356	357	phazarika	She was quite out of sight ahead of me upon the winding trail when suddenly I heard her calling my name aloud.	NMOS
198	199	dung	By the way, what is this mark upon the iguanodon's hide?	NMOS
85	86	dung	At dawn and at sunset the howler monkeys screamed together and the parrakeets broke into shrill chatter, but during the hot hours of the day only the full drone of insects, like the beat of a distant surf, filled the ear, while nothing moved amid the solemn vistas of stupendous trunks, fading away into the darkness which held us in.	MOS
773	774	jtopa	I’ll be down in a minute.	NMOS
862	863	ppromthaww	The teeth of one had closed upon his arm.	NMOS
963	964	ppromthaww	She sprang savagely at the thing that had hurt her.	NMOS
437	438	tranguyen	On some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, a half-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck were motionless and silent, as if devoid of life.	MOS
337	338	phazarika	The girl’s tones were angry and imperious.	NMOS
582	583	tranguyen	The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent that one could look through the walls as easily as though a window. 	MOS
719	720	jtopa	He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.	NMOS
863	864	ppromthaww	Instinctively he leaped into the fire, and as he leaped, he felt the sharp slash of teeth that tore through the flesh of his leg.	NMOS
535	536	tranguyen	Had there been any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards of the house been so thick and stout, escape would have been easy; but to remain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, and they did not like the darkness or the damp smell.	NMOS
460	461	tranguyen	The girl's hair was soft and fluffy and her skin as smooth as satin.	MOS
196	197	dung	Our two professors sat in absorbed argument, examining piece after piece, which showed the marks of savage teeth and of enormous claws.	NMOS
735	736	jtopa	No one encouraged him to talk.	NMOS
877	878	ppromthaww	Half a dozen men were about the man who crouched in the centre of the dying fire.	NMOS
266	267	phazarika	His great fists were flailing about in a most terrifying manner, and his mouth was open just as though he intended eating me alive; but for some reason I felt no fear.	MOS
936	937	ppromthaww	The feel of spring was in the air, the feel of growing life under the snow, of sap ascending in the trees, of buds bursting the shackles of the frost.	MOS
292	293	phazarika	It was my plan to drift slowly over one of the larger valleys as we descended, and make a landing amidst the vegetation which we perceived growing in riotous profusion and movement beneath us	MOS
79	80	dung	It was a cheery companion, gurgling and chuckling as it ran, like the dear old trout-stream in the West Country where I have fished at night in my boyhood.	MOS
677	678	jtopa	The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore	NMOS
682	683	jtopa	Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.	MOS
680	681	jtopa	Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.	MOS
497	498	tranguyen	These royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have come to the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland.	NMOS
802	803	ppromthaww	Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs.	NMOS
954	955	ppromthaww	Yet all three animals were keyed to a tenseness of living that was almost painful, and scarcely ever would it come to them to be more alive than they were then in their seeming petrifaction.	MOS
813	814	ppromthaww	He noticed that his cup was empty and started to reach for the pot.	NMOS
315	316	phazarika	I told him that I had no such longing.	NMOS
106	107	dung	If I could only get a single good, meaty sentence which seemed to convey some sort of definite human idea, it would serve my turn.	NMOS
311	312	phazarika	Nor was I wrong, for this was the chief or king of the tribe into whose clutches Fate had thrown us.	NMOS
291	292	phazarika	This room, which was just forward of the engine-room, was in effect a circular conning-tower which projected about twelve inches above the upper hull.	MOS
479	480	tranguyen	Their eyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like coal-scuttles. But their bodies don't seem very big.	MOS
480	481	tranguyen	Before them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, and now the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard, where splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot their silvery sprays into the air.	NMOS
411	412	tranguyen	How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess, she was so greatly bewildered.	NMOS
556	557	tranguyen	They did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts were gladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crack in the roof of the cave, far overhead.	MOS
930	931	ppromthaww	One Eye was hungry.	NMOS
529	530	tranguyen	"Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more of the awful ""bangs"" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced in a swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them."	MOS
726	727	jtopa	One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home	NMOS
508	509	tranguyen	What shall we do now? asked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, for such a crime had cast a gloom over all the company.	NMOS
216	217	phazarika	Upon the inner side, the flames were spreading throughout the city, roaring like a mighty furnace and vomiting up great clouds of smoke, for though the Laythean terraces are supported by tremendous arches of masonry, yet there is much wood used in the interior construction of the buildings, while the hangings and the furniture are all inflammable.	MOS
938	939	ppromthaww	When morning came and a dim light pervaded the lair, he again sought after the source of the remotely familiar sounds.	MOS
347	348	phazarika	I could see that she was afraid though she tried to hide it from me, putting on a brave front that I was sure she was far from feeling.	NMOS
274	275	phazarika	I had spent much of my summer life in the water of the river so that I was as much at home in that liquid element as in air	MOS
951	952	ppromthaww	He lay down in the snow, depositing the ptarmigan beside him, and with eyes peering through the needles of a low-growing spruce he watched the play of life before him—the waiting lynx and the waiting porcupine, each intent on life; and, such was the curiousness of the game, the way of life for one lay in the eating of the other, and the way of life for the other lay in being not eaten.	MOS
842	843	ppromthaww	He wondered how and when the meal would begin.	NMOS
706	707	jtopa	Yes, I heard from mother so last week	NMOS
171	172	dung	It was midday before we had made ourselves secure, but the heat was not oppressive, and the general character of the plateau, both in its temperature and in its vegetation, was almost temperate.	NMOS
161	162	dung	Far down were the small dark figures of our servants, looking up at us.	NMOS
329	330	phazarika	According to your theory the smaller would all commence to revolve about the larger and they would go flying thus wildly around in the air forever, but that is not what would happen.	NMOS
994	995	ppromthaww	The cub had broken through the wall of the world, the unknown had let go its hold of him, and here he was without hurt.	MOS
498	499	tranguyen	The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy and in good spirits.	NMOS
454	455	tranguyen	It was all laid out into lovely lawns and gardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there.	NMOS
753	754	jtopa	She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.	NMOS
587	588	tranguyen	I'm as hungry as the horse is, and I want my milk.	NMOS
538	539	tranguyen	"You must be very quiet, warned the kitten; ""for if you make the least noise the Gargoyles will wake up. They can hear a pin drop."""	NMOS
361	362	phazarika	And then I seized the pole very gently and lowered myself over the edge.	NMOS
413	414	tranguyen	With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.	NMOS
932	933	ppromthaww	He kept awaking and cocking his ears at the bright world without, where the April sun was blazing across the snow.	NMOS
991	992	ppromthaww	This was more of the terrible unknown.	MOS
875	876	ppromthaww	There were cries of men, and churn of sleds, the creaking of harnesses, and the eager whimpering of straining dogs.	NMOS
581	582	tranguyen	The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soon both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out below them.	NMOS
733	734	jtopa	They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.	NMOS
727	728	jtopa	That must have saved you much.	NMOS
546	547	tranguyen	Our friends had a good start and were able to maintain it, for with their eight wings they could go just as fast as could the Gargoyles.	NMOS
922	923	ppromthaww	As they slid along, noiseless as shadows, in the moonlight, they came upon a run-way.	MOS
900	901	ppromthaww	And in the meanwhile, the she-wolf, the cause of it all, sat down contentedly on her haunches and watched.	NMOS
630	631	jtopa	Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.	NMOS
525	526	tranguyen	In this way none of them was shocked by the dreadful report more than once, for the main band kept far away and each time a new company was sent into the battle.	NMOS
674	675	jtopa	George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.	MOS
537	538	tranguyen	He fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in his satchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening.	NMOS
515	516	tranguyen	And now, the trial being over, the good citizens of the Emerald City scattered to their homes, well content with the day's amusement.	NMOS
417	418	tranguyen	The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soon both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out below them.	NMOS
76	77	dung	Two creatures like large armadillos had come down to the drinking-place, and were squatting at the edge of the water, their long, flexible tongues like red ribbons shooting in and out as they lapped.	MOS
958	959	ppromthaww	The paw, with rigid claws curving like talons, shot under the tender belly and came back with a swift ripping movement.	MOS
259	260	phazarika	As my eyes rested upon the thing her pointing finger indicated, I leaped to my feet with an exclamation of incredulity, for there, sailing parallel with the coast at an altitude of not more than a thousand feet, was a ship, the lines of which I knew as I had known my mother’s face.	MOS
180	181	dung	Put it down in your diary, my young friend, and send it to your rag.	NMOS
850	851	ppromthaww	They remained in a circle about him and his fire, displaying an arrogance of possession that shook his courage born of the morning light.	MOS
371	372	phazarika	As we came to the pile of hooked poles which marked the last turn before the entrance of the tunnel I breathed an inward sigh of relief.	NMOS
231	232	phazarika	Far below me, like a narrow buckskin thong, lay the trail filled with tiny people and horses no bigger than rabbits.	MOS
8	9	dung	There was a pale-green foreground of feathery vegetation, which sloped upwards and ended in a line of cliffs dark red in color, and curiously ribbed like some basaltic formations which I have seen.	MOS
217	218	phazarika	In my heart of hearts I knew that I should be too late, for once they had decided to make the attempt, the ship would drop like a plummet into the depths, and by the time I reached the mouth of the abyss it would be lost to my view forever.	MOS
320	321	phazarika	We were soaked to the skin and very cold, for the rain evidently came from a great altitude.	NMOS
544	545	tranguyen	The only thing that anyone could complain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up and then down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as the air could make it.	NMOS
642	643	jtopa	She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.	MOS
470	471	tranguyen	Below them was a vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling billows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up.	MOS
455	456	tranguyen	There were orchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our world.	NMOS
814	815	ppromthaww	"They’re damn hungry, Henry, an’ they’ll have you an’ me guessin’ before this trip’s over."""	NMOS
312	313	phazarika	Shortly after we arrived at the village, they took away our watches, our pocket-knives, and everything that we possessed of a similar nature, and which they considered as curiosities.	NMOS
986	987	ppromthaww	For she knew that in the lynx’s lair was a litter of kittens, and she knew the lynx for a fierce, bad-tempered creature and a terrible fighter. 	MOS
772	773	jtopa	I’ve brought someone to see you.	NMOS
494	495	tranguyen	The other was a great Tiger with purple stripes around his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed through the half closed lids like coals of fire.	MOS
257	258	phazarika	For just a moment Nah-ee-lah stood there looking at them in silence, as though in prayer, and then she turned wearily away and left the chamber, closing the door behind her.	MOS
617	618	jtopa	But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.	MOS
610	611	jtopa	If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence.	MOS
60	61	dung	In shape they were like horrible toads, and moved in a succession of springs, but in size they were of an incredible bulk, larger than the largest elephant.	MOS
302	303	phazarika	Immediately upon my advance, one of the creatures turned and spoke to another, indicating to us for the first time that they possessed a spoken language.	NMOS
795	796	jtopa	He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.	NMOS
237	238	phazarika	I had not seen her before, or else, like some of the tiny lizards of the desert, she had the power to change her appearance as they change their colors, for this was not the same girl to whom I had been talking a moment since—this was a new and wonderful creature of a loveliness beyond all compare.	MOS
149	150	dung	The dark indicate vegetable decay, while the others point to clayey soil.	NMOS
897	898	ppromthaww	With full stomachs, bickering and quarrelling began among the younger males, and this continued through the few days that followed before the breaking-up of the pack.	NMOS
393	394	phazarika	The ceremony of our entrance to the imperial terrace was most gorgeous and impressive.	NMOS
208	209	phazarika	Their hysterical flight was like the terrorized rush of wild cattle.	MOS
507	508	tranguyen	Jellia at once departed on the errand, and she was gone so long that they had almost forgotten her mission when the green robed maiden returned with a troubled face.	NMOS
638	639	jtopa	She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.	MOS
871	872	ppromthaww	When he had thus disappeared within his shelter of flame, the whole pack came curiously to the rim of the fire to see what had become of him. 	MOS
219	220	phazarika	It was like a revelation from above, and of a sudden I found myself smiling and in the instant a miracle occurred—all fear of these hideous beasts dissolved from my brain like thin air and with it fear of man as well.	MOS
567	568	tranguyen	Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.	NMOS
268	269	phazarika	Into this opening I led Juana—taking her by the hand as one might a blind person, although it was not so dark within that she could not see perfectly every step she took.	NMOS
232	233	phazarika	They breed like rabbits.	MOS
723	724	jtopa	That last remark struck me as so particularly true.	NMOS
569	570	tranguyen	Then the boy cracked his whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.	NMOS
297	298	phazarika	With what fidelity my memory permitted I repeated to them in Orthis’ own words his request for mercy.	NMOS
346	347	phazarika	She shuddered a little at the thought of going out into the terrors of the storm.	NMOS
131	132	dung	I don't think that I am a particularly brave man.	NMOS
159	160	dung	Then with a little confidential chuckle of laughter, he patted me two or three times on the chest, finally pushing me back into my chair.	NMOS
946	947	ppromthaww	As the track led his way, he followed, prepared to meet the maker of it at every turn of the stream.	NMOS
693	694	jtopa	He was medieval. Like a Gothic statue.	MOS
699	700	jtopa	It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.	MOS
186	187	dung	At last, however, as we reached the thicker woods they gave up the chase, and we saw them no more.	NMOS
728	729	jtopa	This is too much!	NMOS
111	112	dung	I must keep up my deception for at least a little time longer, otherwise here was evidently an end of the interview.	NMOS
33	34	dung	Their methods are as reasonable as to try to pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through a non-conducting pipe, which could by the least effort be opened.	NMOS
112	113	dung	He took my letter from his desk and laid it out before him.	NMOS
868	869	ppromthaww	“You ain’t got me yet!” he cried, savagely shaking his fist at the hungry beasts; and at the sound of his voice the whole circle was agitated, there was a general snarl, and the she-wolf slid up close to him across the snow and watched him with hungry wistfulness.	NMOS
429	430	tranguyen	It was not so high as the glowing star of the six colored suns, but was descending slowly through the air—so slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to move.	MOS
218	219	phazarika	Though my lungs were pumping like bellows, I venture to say that my heart stood still for several seconds before I topped the crater’s rim.	MOS
782	783	jtopa	It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.	NMOS
379	380	phazarika	To my right I could see the terraced steps extending downward to the rim of the crater.	NMOS
125	126	dung	I nursed my eye and was silent.	NMOS
331	332	phazarika	Our guards hastened us then, to greater speed, until, at a full run, we mounted the steep slope of the ridge and halted upon its crest.	NMOS
327	328	phazarika	It made him very angry and he threatened me with all kinds of things if I didn’t desist, but I only answered by suggesting that he take an easier gait, which at last he was forced to do.	NMOS
195	196	dung	In the morning it was not long before we discovered the source of the hideous uproar which had aroused us in the night.	NMOS
272	273	phazarika	“Ten years!” he exclaimed, as one might announce a sentence of death, for such it was.	MOS
128	129	dung	When we arrived at the hall we found a much greater concourse than I had expected.	NMOS
427	428	tranguyen	But he had no hair at all, and all over his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharp thorns like those found on the branches of rose-bushes.	MOS
496	497	tranguyen	This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiant King of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess Ozma.	NMOS
68	69	dung	"Four of them carried him shoulder high, and he went like a Roman emperor. What's that?"""	MOS
187	188	dung	But surely no men ever had just such a day since the world began.	NMOS
398	399	phazarika	I let them think that I was.	NMOS
401	402	tranguyen	Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his drooping ears, but that was all.	NMOS
203	204	phazarika	He was drunker than I had thought him, and he turned upon me like a tiger.	MOS
396	397	phazarika	I shook my head.	NMOS
166	167	dung	His wiry energy is wonderful in so frail a frame.	NMOS
239	240	phazarika	Before us was the steep acclivity of the opposite side and like a cat Red Lightning pawed and scrambled his way up, clinging motionless at times for an instant, his toes dug deep into the yielding earth, while I held my breath as Fate decided whether he should hold his own or slip back into the ravine; but at last we made it and once more were upon the summit of the ridge.	MOS
918	919	ppromthaww	After a time the she-wolf began to grow restless.	NMOS
771	772	jtopa	They might amuse you.	NMOS
453	454	tranguyen	By journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful valley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another rugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and pretty green hills at the ends.	MOS
955	956	ppromthaww	Not quite entirely had the porcupine unrolled when it discovered its enemy. 	NMOS
99	100	dung	Then, as quick as a flash, came an expression of overpowering fear.	MOS
542	543	tranguyen	Just you light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don't waste any time about it, either.	NMOS
962	963	ppromthaww	The lynx’s bad temper got the best of her.	NMOS
183	184	dung	From this crawling flapping mass of obscene reptilian life came the shocking clamor which filled the air and the mephitic, horrible, musty odor which turned us sick.	NMOS
59	60	dung	Challenger, like a glad father in the presence of his first-born, stood smiling and stroking his beard, in silent, self-satisfied content as he gazed at the creation of his brain.	MOS
652	653	jtopa	However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.	MOS
426	427	tranguyen	Instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then it slowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange personage seated upon a glass throne just before Jim's nose.	MOS
739	740	jtopa	She did not answer.	NMOS
189	190	dung	One other memory remains with me of this wonderful day, and with it I will close this letter.	NMOS
14	15	dung	And so, amid shouting and cheering, our fate was decided, and I found myself borne away in the human current which swirled towards the door, with my mind half stunned by the vast new project which had risen so suddenly before it.	MOS
448	449	tranguyen	Half way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond the point where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it.	MOS
368	369	phazarika	I envied them their slender spears and their daggers.	NMOS
352	353	phazarika	There was something about the head and face which suggested the cat family to me, yet there was really no resemblance between it and any of the earthly felines.	NMOS
760	761	jtopa	Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.	NMOS
249	250	phazarika	Then I swung for its head as a batter swings for a pitched ball.	MOS
88	89	dung	On the last evening he seems to have hid himself near the hut in which we were discussing our plans, and, being observed by our huge negro Zambo, who is as faithful as a dog and has the hatred which all his race bear to the half-breeds, he was dragged out and carried into our presence.	MOS
554	555	tranguyen	This rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion, turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot.	MOS
96	97	dung	I knew little of prehistoric life, but I had a clear remembrance of one book which I had read in which it spoke of creatures who would live upon our lions and tigers as a cat lives upon mice.	MOS
519	520	tranguyen	The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard knots from trees, worn smooth in course of time.	NMOS
95	96	dung	To a man of philosophic temperament like myself the blood-tick, with its lancet-like proboscis and its distending stomach, is as beautiful a work of Nature as the peacock or, for that matter, the aurora borealis.	MOS
349	350	phazarika	We had crossed these and were upon a plateau at the foot of the higher peaks.	NMOS
10	11	dung	You are a Columbus of science who has discovered a lost world.	MOS
403	404	tranguyen	The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock.	MOS
981	982	ppromthaww	Their hair already betrayed the reddish hue inherited from their mother, the she-wolf; while he alone, in this particular, took after his father.	MOS
665	666	jtopa	Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.	MOS
791	792	jtopa	He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.	NMOS
541	542	tranguyen	The boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement.	NMOS
407	408	tranguyen	The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds as it swept over the valley.	NMOS
267	268	phazarika	It was as food to a starving man to know that even one of our oppressors feared me.	MOS
751	752	jtopa	As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.	NMOS
852	853	ppromthaww	The snarling of his dogs was losing its efficacy.	NMOS
418	419	tranguyen	These spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbled upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury.	MOS
431	432	tranguyen	I am delighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top of it. Were you ever with a circus, brother?	NMOS
928	929	ppromthaww	His sliding gait had been deceptively swift, but it was as nothing to the speed at which he now ran.	MOS
