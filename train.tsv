254	255	phazarika	Already the corpses lay stacked as high as a man’s head, yet no single member of Ko-tah’s forces had crossed the threshold.	MOS
182	183	dung	It was bowl-shaped and at the bottom, some hundreds of yards from where we lay, were pools of green-scummed, stagnant water, fringed with bullrushes.	NMOS
48	49	dung	It was a wonderful sight to see at least a hundred creatures of such enormous size and hideous appearance all swooping like swallows with swift, shearing wing-strokes above us; but soon we realized that it was not one on which we could afford to linger.	MOS
609	610	jtopa	“And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.	MOS
140	141	dung	So much, for the moment, for my two white companions, whose characters and limitations will be further exposed, as surely as my own, as this narrative proceeds.	NMOS
343	344	phazarika	Most of this is very strong, but some of it is not, especially that which is improperly cured.	NMOS
105	106	dung	My scientific education having been somewhat neglected, I was unable to follow the whole argument, but it was evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very aggressive fashion, and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental colleagues.	NMOS
639	640	jtopa	Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks. She will read all kinds of books.	NMOS
78	79	dung	Now, as I looked up at the same cliffs, I saw discs of light in every direction, ruddy, clearly-defined patches, like the port-holes of a liner in the darkness.	MOS
263	264	phazarika	It was a huge beast, almost as large as a full grown goat, and easily a match for several men as poorly armed as I.	MOS
558	559	tranguyen	I'm afraid I've got you into a lot of trouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy cave.	NMOS
66	67	dung	Lord Roxton had had nothing but some fruit since the morning before and ate like a starving man.	MOS
879	880	ppromthaww	He looked at them like a drunken man and maundered in strange, sleepy speech.	MOS
523	524	tranguyen	The Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his enemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent place.	MOS
531	532	tranguyen	The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eureka assisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bit at them like a wild-cat.	MOS
250	251	phazarika	Nearly all the terraces were covered with vegetation, and in numerous places I saw what appeared to be Va-gas feeding upon the plants, and this I later learned was the fact, and that the Kalkars, when they are able to capture members of the race of Va-gas, keep them in captivity and breed them as we breed cattle, for their flesh	MOS
117	118	dung	Now he suddenly turned himself sideways, and all I could see of him was tangled hair with a red, protruding ear.	NMOS
44	45	dung	They had slate-colored skin, which was scaled like a lizard's and shimmered where the sun shone upon it.	MOS
700	701	jtopa	She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.	MOS
63	64	dung	Both the guards who held Summerlee were down, and he was staggering about like a drunken man in his amazement, unable to realize that he was a free man.	MOS
336	337	phazarika	The more I thought about it the more reason I saw in her point of view.	NMOS
696	697	jtopa	As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.	MOS
303	304	phazarika	I pointed to Orthis and to myself, and then to the trail along which we had come, and then back in the direction of the ship.	NMOS
713	714	jtopa	Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.	NMOS
708	709	jtopa	Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.	NMOS
26	27	dung	The man-servant, Austin, like a wooden image, closed the door behind us.	MOS
945	946	ppromthaww	A mile above the forks, running velvet-footed as was his custom, a gliding shadow that cautiously prospected each new vista of the trail, he came upon later imprints of the large tracks he had discovered in the early morning.	MOS
653	654	jtopa	That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.	MOS
157	158	dung	It was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into one's day's work.	NMOS
730	731	jtopa	Oh, so he has a wife.	NMOS
747	748	jtopa	For a moment the two girls looked at each other.	NMOS
330	331	phazarika	She laughed at that quite merrily.	NMOS
289	290	phazarika	What blows I struck I struck for her, what I parried, it was as though I parried from her soft skin.	MOS
906	907	ppromthaww	When the young leader lay in the snow and moved no more, One Eye stalked over to the she-wolf.	NMOS
534	535	tranguyen	They were tower-like in shape and the best of them seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and substantial.	NMOS
222	223	phazarika	It was for all the world like the charge of the great bull I had just vanquished, except that I think that Vonbulen was angrier than the bull and not so good looking.	MOS
385	386	phazarika	It was quickly over, however, and we had entered the tunnel which now led without further confusing ramifications directly to the crater.	NMOS
430	431	tranguyen	The little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she was.	NMOS
858	859	ppromthaww	And then he awoke to find the howling real.	NMOS
258	259	phazarika	In his right hand he held a large, cylindrical object, and as he ceased speaking he hurled it at the gates precisely as a baseball pitcher pitches a swift ball.	MOS
388	389	phazarika	I did as he bade, and a moment later his hands grasped the rim of the crater and with my assistance he gained the top, dragging the spears after him.	NMOS
355	356	phazarika	It reared up and struck at me with its talons now, but I met it again with my bludgeon and this time I broke a fore leg.	NMOS
34	35	dung	He got delirium on Toosday, and has been ragin' like a devil ever since.	MOS
212	213	phazarika	“I dislike the idea of flying like a scared rabbit, but neither would there be any great wisdom in facing armed men without a single weapon of defense.”	MOS
637	638	jtopa	When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.	NMOS
763	764	jtopa	No, I have said nothing indiscreet.	NMOS
627	628	jtopa	But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it	NMOS
511	512	tranguyen	I do not think the innocent kitten can be guilty, and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder.	NMOS
662	663	jtopa	Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality	NMOS
146	147	dung	About June the waters begin to fall, and are at their lowest at October or November.	NMOS
755	756	jtopa	For a moment the original trouble was in the background.	NMOS
1000	1001	ppromthaww	He was justifying his existence, than which life can do no greater; for life achieves its summit when it does to the uttermost that which it was equipped to do.	MOS
964	965	ppromthaww	But the porcupine, squealing and grunting, with disrupted anatomy trying feebly to roll up into its ball-protection, flicked out its tail again, and again the big cat squalled with hurt and astonishment	MOS
442	443	tranguyen	The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully cut jewels set close together;	MOS
606	607	jtopa	He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.	MOS
979	980	ppromthaww	He was behaving as a wolf-father should, and manifesting no unholy desire to devour the young lives she had brought into the world.	MOS
247	248	phazarika	Of course, my lunar weight was equivalent to only about thirty pounds on Earth while our captors seemed fully as well-muscled as a small earthly horse, and as we later learned, were capable of carrying heavy burdens.	MOS
90	91	dung	To my astounded senses the one seems most terrible and the other as black as night.	MOS
743	744	jtopa	He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.	NMOS
229	230	phazarika	A great Kalkar, blowing like a spent hound, was sitting his tired horse between us. At our words he raised his head.	MOS
843	844	ppromthaww	He was the food, and the sight of him excited in her the gustatory sensations.	MOS
517	518	tranguyen	On peering out all they could see was rolling banks of clouds, so thick that they obscured all else.	NMOS
803	804	ppromthaww	Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost	MOS
54	55	dung	He laughed like an idiot, while I made for the door.	MOS
505	506	tranguyen	Several days of festivity and merry-making followed, for such old friends did not often meet and there was much to be told and talked over between them, and many amusements to be enjoyed in this delightful country.	NMOS
162	163	dung	It is not for nothing that I expended an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation.	NMOS
185	186	dung	The moment we attempted to retreat the circle closed in upon us, until the tips of the wings of those nearest to us nearly touched our faces.	NMOS
941	942	ppromthaww	Nevertheless, he made out, sheltering between her legs against the length of her body, five strange little bundles of life, very feeble, very helpless, making tiny whimpering noises, with eyes that did not open to the light.	MOS
631	632	jtopa	They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son	NMOS
326	327	phazarika	What his purpose was in preserving the three prisoners, that would have made such excellent food for the tribe, I did not know.	NMOS
703	704	jtopa	Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.	NMOS
490	491	tranguyen	Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that I suppose you cannot help. Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh and blood and bones.	NMOS
929	930	ppromthaww	Before him was bounding the faint patch of white he had discovered.	NMOS
992	993	ppromthaww	For the time, fear had been routed by growth, while growth had assumed the guise of curiosity.	MOS
925	926	ppromthaww	One Eye ran ahead cautiously, his mate at his heels.	NMOS
710	711	jtopa	Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.	NMOS
888	889	ppromthaww	It was lean with long-standing hunger.	MOS
978	979	ppromthaww	Her instinctive fear of the father of her progeny was toning down.	NMOS
536	537	tranguyen	If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to fly lies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the people who wear them.	NMOS
577	578	tranguyen	She began to realize that death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely started upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and unusual as were those she had before encountered.	NMOS
483	484	tranguyen	Here he found Dorothy seated beside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stopped suddenly with a gasp of admiration.	NMOS
948	949	ppromthaww	It was the maker of the track, a large female lynx.	NMOS
817	818	ppromthaww	They’ll be goin’ mad, yet, an’ then watch out.”	NMOS
287	288	phazarika	A dim light flickered below as though coming from a chamber near the foot of the stairs.	NMOS
717	718	jtopa	His hand was still extended	NMOS
13	14	dung	There was a hush over the hall, the students rigid with delight at seeing the high gods on Olympus quarrelling among themselves.	MOS
692	693	jtopa	Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.	MOS
513	514	tranguyen	"Justice, remarked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, ""is a dangerous thing to meddle with. If you hadn't happened to find the piglet, Eureka would surely have been executed."""	NMOS
459	460	tranguyen	The meat was smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics and jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way.	MOS
748	749	jtopa	But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.	NMOS
87	88	dung	In our own case the excellent engines of the Esmeralda could disregard the sluggish flow of the stream, and we made as rapid progress as if we were navigating a stagnant lake.	MOS
262	263	phazarika	You insulated your aluminum parts, thinking thus to thwart me, but you did not know—your feeble intellect could not know—that as easily as I destroyed aluminum I can, by the simplest of adjustments, attune this weapon to destroy any one of a hundred different substances and among them human flesh or human bone.	MOS
977	978	ppromthaww	But the next instant she was warning him away from the cubs with a snarl that was less harsh than usual and that was more apologetic than menacing.	NMOS
872	873	ppromthaww	Hitherto they had been denied access to the fire, and they now settled down in a close-drawn circle, like so many dogs, blinking and yawning and stretching their lean bodies in the unaccustomed warmth.	MOS
818	819	ppromthaww	To the rear, from around the last bend and plainly into view, on the very trail they had just covered, trotted a furry, slinking form.	NMOS
380	381	phazarika	The fellow before whom I had been brought questioned me briefly.	NMOS
58	59	dung	For a moment I had a vision of four adventurers floating like a string of sausages over the land that they had explored.	MOS
736	737	jtopa	He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets. She thanked him with real pleasure.	NMOS
670	671	jtopa	Of course, it must be a wonderful building. But how like a barn!	MOS
382	383	phazarika	He looked at me for a moment with a puzzled expression in his eyes and then he addressed me.	NMOS
765	766	jtopa	So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.	NMOS
761	762	jtopa	I suppose Anne never told them you were here.	NMOS
592	593	tranguyen	As the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glass city made way for them and formed a procession in their rear.	NMOS
245	246	phazarika	I found myself in a sluggish, yet powerful current, the water seeming to move much as a heavy oil moves to the gravity of Earth.	MOS
784	785	jtopa	It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude	NMOS
590	591	tranguyen	People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals, and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled.	NMOS
381	382	phazarika	I found myself in a dimly lighted, rectangular room, the air of which was very poor, and at the first glance I discovered that I was not alone, for upon a bench against the opposite wall sat a man.	NMOS
983	984	ppromthaww	He had bred true to the straight wolf-stock—in fact, he had bred true to old One Eye himself, physically, with but a single exception, and that was he had two eyes to his father’s one.	MOS
597	598	tranguyen	There was enough material there to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learned from some of the jugglers in the circus, and he had passed part of the night in getting them ready.	NMOS
589	590	tranguyen	Dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were both walking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them.	NMOS
613	614	jtopa	Life like a dome of many coloured glass.	MOS
628	629	jtopa	Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.	NMOS
61	62	dung	He thrust a hollow reed into it and cried out with delight like a schoolboy then he was able, on touching it with a lighted match, to cause a sharp explosion and a blue flame at the far end of the tube.	MOS
115	116	dung	To my amazement he stooped, picked her up, and placed her sitting upon a high pedestal of black marble in the angle of the hall.	NMOS
995	996	ppromthaww	But the first man on Mars would have experienced less unfamiliarity than did he.	MOS
552	553	tranguyen	The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrels and covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly under the light of the lanterns.	MOS
492	493	tranguyen	The cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a neigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf.	MOS
904	905	ppromthaww	She was made glad in vague ways by the battle, for this was the love-making of the Wild, the sex-tragedy of the natural world that was tragedy only to those that died.	MOS
40	41	dung	Challenger struts about like a prize peacock, and Summerlee is silent, but still sceptical.	MOS
952	953	ppromthaww	While old One Eye, the wolf crouching in the covert, played his part, too, in the game, waiting for some strange freak of Chance, that might help him on the meat-trail which was his way of life.	MOS
957	958	ppromthaww	The blow was like a flash of light.	MOS
839	840	ppromthaww	He dozed despite himself, crouching by the fire, the blankets about his shoulders, the axe between his knees, and on either side a dog pressing close against him.	NMOS
321	322	phazarika	We experienced twelve detonations of the ground-shaking thunder, and witnessed six manifestations of the light that devours.	NMOS
619	620	jtopa	The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape	MOS
767	768	jtopa	She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.	NMOS
831	832	ppromthaww	Bill seemed to have forgotten his forebodings of the previous night, and even waxed facetious with the dogs when, at midday, they overturned the sled on a bad piece of trail.	NMOS
568	569	tranguyen	Next minute there was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground open in a wide crack and then come together again.	NMOS
847	848	ppromthaww	When he dozed despite himself, the whimpering and snarling of the dogs aroused him.	NMOS
409	410	tranguyen	Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they waited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for the earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its dreadful depths.	NMOS
720	721	jtopa	Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.	NMOS
694	695	jtopa	Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.	MOS
848	849	ppromthaww	Morning came, but for the first time the light of day failed to scatter the wolves.	MOS
579	580	tranguyen	There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.	NMOS
892	893	ppromthaww	Yet all were more like skeletons than full-bodied wolves.	MOS
640	641	jtopa	Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds	MOS
999	1000	ppromthaww	But the cub saw, and it was a warning and a lesson to him—the swift downward swoop of the hawk, the short skim of its body just above the ground, the strike of its talons in the body of the ptarmigan, the ptarmigan’s squawk of agony and fright, and the hawk’s rush upward into the blue, carrying the ptarmigan away with it.	MOS
465	466	tranguyen	Once a little fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it in her mouth and ate it up as quick as a wink	MOS
345	346	phazarika	As I lay resting after my exertions, I suddenly became aware of a strange, moaning sound from without, and then the hut shook, and I realized that another storm had come.	NMOS
953	954	ppromthaww	Half an hour passed, an hour; and nothing happened. The ball of quills might have been a stone for all it moved; the lynx might have been frozen to marble; and old One Eye might have been dead.	MOS
133	134	dung	It was only the need of getting in the account of my meeting which drew me at last from his company.	NMOS
104	105	dung	It was just after eleven, and the big room was fairly full, though the rush had not yet set in.	NMOS
650	651	jtopa	Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.	NMOS
126	127	dung	A taxicab was waiting at the end of the road, so I sprang into it and drove down to the office.	NMOS
989	990	ppromthaww	But growth demanded disobedience.	NMOS
103	104	dung	That delicately bronzed skin, almost oriental in its coloring, that raven hair, the large liquid eyes, the full but exquisite lips,—all the stigmata of passion were there.	MOS
285	286	phazarika	but those who started up after me never came far, for they and I soon discovered that with their heavy bow I could drive their heavy arrows through their iron vests as if they had been wool.	MOS
323	324	phazarika	When they saw the creature flying weakly overhead, they set up a great noise, until presently all the tribe had run into the open and were looking up at the thing above us.	NMOS
890	891	ppromthaww	At the rear limped the weak members, the very young and the very old.	NMOS
921	922	ppromthaww	Old One Eye was not interested at all, but he followed her good-naturedly in her quest, and when her investigations in particular places were unusually protracted, he would lie down and wait until she was ready to go on.	NMOS
440	441	tranguyen	Her flesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressed both dignity and grace.	MOS
284	285	phazarika	By now all was pandemonium. Yelling and cursing, the balance of the troop galloped into sight and with them I saw such a man as mortal eye may never have rested upon before this time and, let us pray, never may again.	MOS
310	311	phazarika	The latter are very well treated, as the position of a male in a community is dependent largely upon the size of his herd.	NMOS
915	916	ppromthaww	But it was all forgotten the next moment, as he sprang after the she-wolf, who was coyly leading him a chase through the woods.	NMOS
759	760	jtopa	He glanced at the curtains dismally.	NMOS
961	962	ppromthaww	One Eye half arose in his excitement, his ears up, his tail straight out and quivering behind him.	NMOS
2	3	dung	Where the real sex feeling begins, timidity and distrust are its companions, heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in hand.	MOS
209	210	phazarika	During the entire storm, the No-vans scarcely moved from their positions beneath the trees, with their backs toward the storm, where they stood with lowered heads like cattle	MOS
188	189	dung	They were strewn at random all over the ground, and one tin of meat had been crushed into pieces so as to extract the contents.	NMOS
944	945	ppromthaww	It had happened many times, yet each time it was as fresh a surprise as ever to him.	MOS
290	291	phazarika	He did something more to the generator and then arose, crossed the engine-room directly to the door, unbolted it and threw the door open. His hair was dishevelled, his face drawn, his eyes shining with a peculiar light, but withal his expression denoted a drunken elation that I did not at the moment understand	MOS
370	371	phazarika	She laid her hand gently upon my arm.	NMOS
6	7	dung	Did you think you could match cunning with me—you with your walnut of a brain?	MOS
502	503	tranguyen	But the Sawhorse was swifter than the wind.	MOS
873	874	ppromthaww	Then the she-wolf sat down, pointed her nose at a star, and began to howl.	NMOS
178	179	dung	Beyond was an open glade, and in this were five of the most extraordinary creatures that I have ever seen.	NMOS
560	561	tranguyen	It will all happen as quick as a wink.	MOS
920	921	ppromthaww	The hollows under fallen trees seemed to attract her, and she spent much time nosing about among the larger snow-piled crevices in the rocks and in the caves of overhanging banks.	NMOS
648	649	jtopa	I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.	NMOS
43	44	dung	We all sat in amazed silence round the fire, like the heroes of Virgil when the Harpies came down upon them.	MOS
136	137	dung	I will also allude very briefly to our river journey, up a wide, slow-moving, clay-tinted stream, in a steamer which was little smaller than that which had carried us across the Atlantic.	NMOS
798	799	jtopa	Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.	NMOS
466	467	tranguyen	The mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its point was lost in the clouds.	NMOS
197	198	dung	On the dull, scaly, slate-colored skin somewhere above the shoulder, there was a singular black circle of some substance which looked like asphalt.	MOS
629	630	jtopa	Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.	NMOS
318	319	phazarika	The trees bend before they break, and those who watch are warned, and they escape destruction if they are quick.	NMOS
660	661	jtopa	at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people	NMOS
369	370	phazarika	She did as I bade, and slowly we backed toward the mouth of the tunnel.	NMOS
800	801	jtopa	They hurried home through a world of black and grey.	NMOS
435	436	tranguyen	We are all vegetable, in this country. Are you not vegetable, also?	MOS
135	136	dung	I leave the strict observance of my conditions entirely to your honor.	NMOS
942	943	ppromthaww	He was surprised.	NMOS
282	283	phazarika	He told me that the trail upon which he was camped led to the summit of the hills, joining with another that led straight down into a great valley which he thought would lead me to my destination, but of that he was not sure, having only such knowledge of the extent of the valley as one might glean from viewing it from the summit of his loftiest hills.	MOS
902	903	ppromthaww	This was her day—and it came not often—when manes bristled, and fang smote fang or ripped and tore the yielding flesh, all for the possession of her.	NMOS
132	133	dung	There are times, young fellah, when every one of us must make a stand for human right and justice, or you never feel clean again.	NMOS
129	130	dung	Why on earth people who have something to say which is worth hearing should not take the slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange mysteries of modern life.	NMOS
464	465	tranguyen	They now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage, and after the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shaped mountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to travel in order to reach it, they again started upon their journey.	NMOS
533	534	tranguyen	All of them expected nothing less than instant death; but to their surprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore them far away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to a wooden city.	NMOS
80	81	dung	As the eyes became more used to the obscurity one learned that there were different degrees of darkness among the trees—that some were dimly visible, while between and among them there were coal-black shadowed patches, like the mouths of caves, from which I shrank in horror as I passed.	MOS
891	892	ppromthaww	At the front were the strongest.	NMOS
876	877	ppromthaww	Four sleds pulled in from the river bed to the camp among the trees.	NMOS
659	660	jtopa	The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.	MOS
804	805	ppromthaww	There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.	NMOS
100	101	dung	After all, my rifle would probably have been as useless as a shot-gun against such dangers as I might meet.	MOS
118	119	dung	He helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical pair of eyes, taking note of the effect which this document would produce.	NMOS
878	879	ppromthaww	They were shaking and prodding him into consciousness.	NMOS
62	63	dung	Personally I felt shy and uncomfortable at this obsequious adoration, and I read the same feeling in the faces of Roxton and Summerlee, but Challenger expanded like a flower in the sun.	MOS
697	698	jtopa	The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.	MOS
908	909	ppromthaww	He was plainly expectant of a rebuff, and he was just as plainly surprised when her teeth did not flash out at him in anger.	NMOS
491	492	tranguyen	"I can see the bones all right, replied the Sawhorse, ""and they are admirable and distinct."	NMOS
576	577	tranguyen	Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier.	NMOS
646	647	jtopa	I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.	NMOS
820	821	ppromthaww	It looked at them in a strangely wistful way, after the manner of a dog; but in its wistfulness there was none of the dog affection.	NMOS
887	888	ppromthaww	But the situation of the pack was desperate.	NMOS
547	548	tranguyen	But the road was nothing more than a series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in every direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled as to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when they had started, hours before.	NMOS
313	314	phazarika	It is a very difficult language to speak, and as a written language, would be practically impossible.	NMOS
256	257	phazarika	We saw a hundred ladders raised as if by magic toward the lowest terrace, which rose but a bare two hundred feet above the base of the city.	MOS
4	5	dung	A huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table, save for two enormous hands covered with long black hair.	MOS
452	453	tranguyen	Jim hastened his lagging steps at this assurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few moments more they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to face with a new and charming country.	NMOS
634	635	jtopa	Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.	MOS
959	960	ppromthaww	Had the porcupine been entirely unrolled, or had it not discovered its enemy a fraction of a second before the blow was struck, the paw would have escaped unscathed; but a side-flick of the tail sank sharp quills into it as it was withdrawn.	NMOS
603	604	jtopa	But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?	MOS
663	664	jtopa	The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.	MOS
718	719	jtopa	As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.	MOS
993	994	ppromthaww	After that he sat up and gazed about him, as might the first man of the earth who landed upon Mars.	MOS
789	790	jtopa	I would never have let myself go.	NMOS
685	686	jtopa	Lucy had a spasm of envy.	MOS
342	343	phazarika	She was standing wide-eyed and tense, watching them drag me away.	NMOS
919	920	ppromthaww	She seemed to be searching for something that she could not find.	NMOS
124	125	dung	When men like yourself, who represent the foolish curiosity of the public, came to disturb my privacy I was unable to meet them with dignified reserve.	NMOS
867	868	ppromthaww	His two dogs were missing, and he well knew that they had served as a course in the protracted meal which had begun days before with Fatty, the last course of which would likely be himself in the days to follow.	MOS
705	706	jtopa	He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful	NMOS
668	669	jtopa	there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful	NMOS
53	54	dung	When at last his ruffled feelings were at ease, he addressed us at some length from his seat upon a fallen tree, speaking, as his habit was, as if he were imparting most precious information to a class of a thousand.	MOS
787	788	jtopa	That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.	NMOS
9	10	dung	It was a dull gray landscape, and as I gradually deciphered the details of it I realized that it represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly like an immense cataract seen in the distance, with a sloping, tree-clad plain in the foreground.	MOS
420	421	tranguyen	The rainbow tints from the colored suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many delicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.	NMOS
997	998	ppromthaww	His was the luck of the beginner.	MOS
332	333	phazarika	The ferocity of the scene below us was almost indescribable.	NMOS
467	468	tranguyen	The stairs were cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad and not very steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and at the arched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big.	MOS
395	396	phazarika	He spoke more freely and his manner was more democratic.	NMOS
134	135	dung	It was very clear to me that if dangers lay before us I could not in all England have found a cooler head or a braver spirit with which to share them.	NMOS
830	831	ppromthaww	The day began auspiciously. 	NMOS
462	463	tranguyen	We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can not display our beauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely to our companions. Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature, the dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of the sky.	NMOS
141	142	dung	The air was calm, full of the eternal hum of insects, a tropical chorus of many octaves, from the deep drone of the bee to the high, keen pipe of the mosquito.	NMOS
566	567	tranguyen	He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank.	NMOS
698	699	jtopa	Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.	NMOS
270	271	phazarika	When they had come, he again addressed Juana, who had risen and stood swaying to and fro, as might one who has been dealt a heavy blow upon the head and half-stunned.	MOS
980	981	ppromthaww	He was different from his brothers and sisters.	NMOS
179	180	dung	What would he not give for one such head to place between the two crossed oars above the mantelpiece in his snuggery at the Albany!	NMOS
701	702	jtopa	The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.	NMOS
204	205	phazarika	You have gone too far this time, and now you dare to order me about like a dog and an inferior—I, whose brains have made you what you are.	MOS
819	820	ppromthaww	Together they watched the strange animal that had pursued them for days and that had already accomplished the destruction of half their dog-team.	NMOS
487	488	tranguyen	Zeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people; but they were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them very much, even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen.	NMOS
472	473	tranguyen	On peering out all they could see was rolling banks of clouds, so thick that they obscured all else.	NMOS
234	235	phazarika	The children were like tiny toys, so diminutive were they, and, like their fathers and mothers, quite naked, nor was there among them all the sign of an ornament or decoration of any nature.	MOS
549	550	tranguyen	What sort of a place is this? asked the boy, trying to see more clearly through the gloom.	NMOS
373	374	phazarika	The fellow who had captured me was in very good humor, doubtless because of his success, and when he discovered that I had regained consciousness he started to converse with me.	NMOS
764	765	jtopa	I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.	NMOS
907	908	ppromthaww	His carriage was one of mingled triumph and caution.	MOS
785	786	jtopa	She was going to answer	NMOS
933	934	ppromthaww	When he dozed, upon his ears would steal the faint whispers of hidden trickles of running water, and he would rouse and listen intently.	MOS
402	403	tranguyen	Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me. I'm a splendid worker. I work as well as I sleep,	MOS
5	6	dung	Well, at least you are better than that herd of swine in Vienna, whose gregarious grunt is, however, not more offensive than the isolated effort of the British hog.	MOS
213	214	phazarika	We were cornered like rats in a trap.	MOS
561	562	tranguyen	For they were in the streets of a beautiful emerald-green city, bathed in a grateful green light that was especially pleasing to their eyes, and surrounded by merry faced people in gorgeous green-and-gold costumes of many extraordinary designs.	NMOS
114	115	dung	A policeman was beside us, his notebook in his hand.	NMOS
574	575	tranguyen	The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great crack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about to overtake them at any moment.	NMOS
51	52	dung	One by one he took out a succession of beautiful rifles, opening and shutting them with a snap and a clang, and then patting them as he put them back into the rack as tenderly as a mother would fondle her children.	MOS
57	58	dung	They were neatly done in charcoal upon the white surface, and looked to me at first sight like some sort of rough musical score.	MOS
633	634	jtopa	The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.	NMOS
695	696	jtopa	He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.	MOS
975	976	ppromthaww	There was a final defiant clash of the long teeth.	NMOS
7	8	dung	Besides, a little glow of righteous anger was springing up within me.	MOS
191	192	dung	So strong was the impression that I told Professor Challenger of it, who put it down to the cerebral excitement caused by my fever.	NMOS
621	622	jtopa	She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings	MOS
575	576	tranguyen	These they could not see, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamed almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck his boney body.	NMOS
550	551	tranguyen	There was a regretful accent in the creature's voice, and at the words all the other dragonettes sighed dismally.	NMOS
405	406	tranguyen	There was a breath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would shake violently.	MOS
271	272	phazarika	Pthav scowled at this and ordered her from the room just as a man might order a beast around.	MOS
841	842	ppromthaww	And he was the food they were to eat!	NMOS
769	770	jtopa	The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.	NMOS
870	871	ppromthaww	Inside this circle he crouched, his sleeping outfit under him as a protection against the melting snow. 	MOS
864	865	ppromthaww	Then began a fire fight.	NMOS
624	625	jtopa	So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.	MOS
350	351	phazarika	In these higher altitudes we found a vegetation that differed materially from that which grew in the lowlands.	NMOS
974	975	ppromthaww	In a little while, One Eye noticed that the quills were drooping and that a great quivering had set up.	NMOS
926	927	ppromthaww	The broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in contact with the snow were like velvet.	MOS
826	827	ppromthaww	“If that pack ever starts to jump you, them three cartridges’d be wuth no more’n three whoops in hell.	MOS
849	850	ppromthaww	The man waited in vain for them to go. 	NMOS
643	644	jtopa	he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.	MOS
917	918	ppromthaww	The days passed by, and they kept together, hunting their meat and killing and eating it in common.	NMOS
851	852	ppromthaww	The night was a repetition of the night before, save that the need for sleep was becoming overpowering.	MOS
756	757	jtopa	In the morning they left for Rome.	NMOS
825	826	ppromthaww	She’s too smart to be shot in the open.	NMOS
856	857	ppromthaww	Mechanically, at short range, without letting go of it, he thrust a brand full into her open and snarling mouth.	NMOS
752	753	jtopa	There was only one way of treating the situation.	NMOS
52	53	dung	A man in white clothes, who could only be the surviving half-breed, was running as one does run when Death is the pacemaker.	MOS
241	242	phazarika	I must have looked up at him quizzically, for he smiled and shook his head as one who is puzzled to find an explanation suited to the mental capacity of his auditor.	MOS
599	600	tranguyen	There was a beautiful canopy for Ozma and her guests to sit under and watch the people run races and jump and wrestle.	NMOS
108	109	dung	It was nearly half-past ten before I had received my message, but a taxicab took me round in good time for my appointment.	NMOS
778	779	jtopa	Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization	NMOS
288	289	phazarika	He wielded his great sword with a master hand and because of the very cowardice which I attributed to him he fought with a frenzy wrought by fear, as a cornered beast fights.	MOS
325	326	phazarika	There was no more muttering then, but I saw several cast hungry eyes at me—hungry, angry eyes that boded me no good.	NMOS
190	191	dung	To avoid their wrangling I moved some little way apart, and was seated smoking upon the trunk of a fallen tree, when Lord John strolled over in my direction.	NMOS
676	677	jtopa	With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory	MOS
522	523	tranguyen	It's every man's duty to do the best he knows how; and I'm going to do it.	NMOS
164	165	dung	Malone and I will go down again, therefore, and we will fetch up the four rifles, together with Gomez and the other.	NMOS
833	834	ppromthaww	One Ear drew near to her, still alert and cautious, his tail and ears in the air, his head held high.	NMOS
344	345	phazarika	The effort, however, was very tiring, and I had to stop often and rest.	NMOS
809	810	ppromthaww	Henry acknowledged receipt of the information with a grunt that slid into a snore as he drifted back into sleep.	NMOS
384	385	phazarika	They not only had neither the training nor the intelligence to develop new things, but they could not carry out the old that had been developed for them.	NMOS
947	948	ppromthaww	He slid his head around a corner of rock, where began an unusually large bend in the stream, and his quick eyes made out something that sent him crouching swiftly down. 	NMOS
35	36	dung	I dare say that I could throw myself over a precipice, like the Hun in the history books, if my courage to do it were questioned, and yet it would surely be pride and fear, rather than courage, which would be my inspiration.	MOS
49	50	dung	His skin was of a rich flower-pot red from sun and wind.	MOS
150	151	dung	Twice we came across rapids, and in each case made a portage of half a mile or so to avoid them.	NMOS
364	365	phazarika	I was about to reply when she placed slim fingers upon my lips.	NMOS
731	732	jtopa	How could you think she was defending them?	NMOS
56	57	dung	In a moment the creature, beating and bumping along the wall like a huge moth within a gas-shade, came upon the opening, squeezed its hideous bulk through it, and was gone.	MOS
509	510	tranguyen	The crime of murder being the most dreadful crime of all, tremendous excitement prevailed in the Emerald City when the news of Eureka's arrest and trial became known.	NMOS
777	778	jtopa	Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.	NMOS
840	841	ppromthaww	And even as he looked, the brute deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy dog, yawning full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive eye, as if, in truth, he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be eaten.	MOS
987	988	ppromthaww	But the Wild is the Wild, and motherhood is motherhood, at all times fiercely protective whether in the Wild or out of it; and the time was to come when the she-wolf, for her grey cub’s sake, would venture the left fork, and the lair in the rocks, and the lynx’s wrath.	NMOS
137	138	dung	I would desire to give a clearer sketch of my comrades in this enterprise, and of the associates whom we had already gathered together in South America.	NMOS
846	847	ppromthaww	All night, with burning brands, he fought off the hungry pack.	NMOS
923	924	ppromthaww	Both noses went down to the footprints in the snow.	NMOS
17	18	dung	You and I could be as far away from each other as Scotland is from Constantinople, and yet each of us be in the same great Brazilian forest.	MOS
227	228	phazarika	I do not say that these men were cowards—I do not believe that they were cowards, and yet they acted like cowards.	NMOS
651	652	jtopa	But why need she go as far as Greece?	NMOS
709	710	jtopa	Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end	NMOS
223	224	phazarika	He turned to see what I wanted, showing his teeth like a rat at bay.	MOS
383	384	phazarika	The Thinkers would not work, and the result was that both government and commerce fell into rapid decay.	NMOS
555	556	tranguyen	The lanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the remaining oil from one into the other, so that the one light would last longer.	NMOS
319	320	phazarika	Rushing down from the hillside, the water poured in torrents into the ravine, and presently, though it must have been twenty or thirty feet deep, it was filled almost to overflowing.	NMOS
666	667	jtopa	There was a haze of disapproval in the air,	NMOS
860	861	ppromthaww	The wolves were rushing him.	NMOS
101	102	dung	I gave the self-evident answer that I should be a ruined man, upon which he jumped from his chair, reproved me for my habitual levity, which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence, and bounced off out of the room to dress for a Masonic meeting.	NMOS
971	972	ppromthaww	It had been ripped almost in half, and was still bleeding profusely.	NMOS
754	755	jtopa	His face lit up	NMOS
924	925	ppromthaww	These footprints were very fresh.	NMOS
607	608	jtopa	She was no dazzling exécutante; her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.	MOS
822	823	ppromthaww	They were meat, and it was hungry; and it would like to go in and eat them if it dared.	MOS
996	997	ppromthaww	Without any antecedent knowledge, without any warning whatever that such existed, he found himself an explorer in a totally new world.	MOS
21	22	dung	Her dear hand rested like warm velvet upon my lips.	MOS
503	504	tranguyen	Its wooden legs moved so fast that their twinkling could scarcely be seen, and although so much smaller than the cab-horse it covered the ground much faster.	NMOS
626	627	jtopa	The child’s legs had become as melting wax.	MOS
565	566	tranguyen	She could count his ribs easily where they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was long and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit.	NMOS
139	140	dung	Like most men of action, he is laconic in speech, and sinks readily into his own thoughts, but he is always quick to answer a question or join in a conversation, talking in a queer, jerky, half-humorous fashion.	NMOS
786	787	jtopa	He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things	NMOS
584	585	tranguyen	The rainbow tints from the colored suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many delicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.	NMOS
896	897	ppromthaww	There was now much resting and sleeping.	NMOS
377	378	phazarika	We moved on after we left the cave for a considerable period of time in silence.	NMOS
456	457	tranguyen	As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enraptured by its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, which they breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel.	NMOS
450	451	tranguyen	Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed the sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor was usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any accident.	MOS
261	262	phazarika	It was Julian 5th who discovered the secret of this deadly weapon and that it accomplished its destruction by projecting upon the ships of the Peace Fleet the vibratory rate of radio-activity identical with that of aluminum, with the result that, thus excited, the electrons of the attacked substance increased their own vibratory rate to a point that they became dissipated again into their elemental and invisible state—in other words, aluminum was transmuted into something else that was as invisible and intangible as ether.	MOS
478	479	tranguyen	let us explore the mountain and discover which way we must go in order to escape from this cavern, which is getting to be almost as hot as a bake-oven.	MOS
914	915	ppromthaww	Then it was that his lips half writhed into a snarl, and the hair of his neck and shoulders involuntarily bristled, while he half crouched for a spring, his claws spasmodically clutching into the snow-surface for firmer footing.	NMOS
351	352	phazarika	Once just after we had rounded the shoulder of a mountain, we came upon a little strip of level land clinging to the side of a mighty peak.	NMOS
151	152	dung	How shall I ever forget the solemn mystery of it?	NMOS
194	195	dung	The thing moved forward with a dreadful snarl.	NMOS
721	722	jtopa	The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.	NMOS
562	563	tranguyen	Before them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, and now the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard, where splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot their silvery sprays into the air.	NMOS
794	795	jtopa	They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.	NMOS
716	717	jtopa	Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.	NMOS
425	426	tranguyen	The people at once followed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room, leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the center of the hall.	NMOS
539	540	tranguyen	The girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his way carefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the ground below.	NMOS
173	174	dung	However, the wind was strong and blew outwards.	NMOS
910	911	ppromthaww	She sniffed noses with him, and even condescended to leap about and frisk and play with him in quite puppyish fashion.	NMOS
32	33	dung	The fellow is as full of tricks as the monkey-house at the Zoo.	MOS
734	735	jtopa	He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.	NMOS
532	533	tranguyen	Eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the ground like a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed her before she had gone very far.	MOS
175	176	dung	Hardly had we started when we came across signs that there were indeed wonders awaiting us.	NMOS
570	571	tranguyen	Jim's ears were standing erect upon his head and every muscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home.	NMOS
812	813	ppromthaww	“An if I get a chance at it, that wolf that’s a dog’ll be jes’ meat,” Bill declared.	MOS
46	47	dung	In their excitement they had unconsciously seized each other by the hand, and stood like two little children in the presence of a marvel, Challenger's cheeks bunched up into a seraphic smile, and Summerlee's sardonic face softening for the moment into wonder and reverence.	MOS
960	961	ppromthaww	Everything had happened at once—the blow, the counter-blow, the squeal of agony from the porcupine, the big cat’s squall of sudden hurt and astonishment.	NMOS
444	445	tranguyen	Then the boy returned to one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass bench was soon deep in slumberland.	NMOS
488	489	tranguyen	Nobody minded this rudeness, which might have seemed more impolite in one less thoroughly educated; so they straightway forgot him and joined in a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bed-time arrived.	NMOS
18	19	dung	The first is a gigantic negro named Zambo, who is a black Hercules, as willing as any horse, and about as intelligent.	MOS
255	256	phazarika	His warriors were close behind him, and it behooved me to work fast, and so I fought as I had never guessed that it lay within me to fight, and at the instant that the rabble broke through the remaining defenders and poured into the throne room of the Jemadars of Laythe, I slipped my point into the heart of Ko-tah.	MOS
251	252	phazarika	But as my eyes met hers the exuberance of my spirit was as effectually and quickly checked by her cold glance and haughty mien as if I had received a blow in the face.	MOS
278	279	phazarika	I held him in one hand as one might a little child—he was utterly helpless in my grip—and I asked Juana if he had wronged her.	MOS
89	90	dung	Clear as crystal, motionless as a sheet of glass, green as the edge of an iceberg, it stretched in front of us under its leafy archway, every stroke of our paddles sending a thousand ripples across its shining surface.	MOS
678	679	jtopa	She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.	MOS
788	789	jtopa	It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.	NMOS
421	422	tranguyen	He was not a very large man, but was well formed and had a beautiful face—calm and serene as the face of a fine portrait.	MOS
949	950	ppromthaww	She was crouching as he had crouched once that day, in front of her the tight-rolled ball of quills.	MOS
205	206	phazarika	Its legs were very short, and as it moved along the ground it both wriggled like a true snake and scrambled with its four short legs.	MOS
156	157	dung	Sir John Ballinger is the best gentleman jock in the north country.	NMOS
988	989	ppromthaww	Fear!—that legacy of the Wild which no animal may escape nor exchange for pottage	MOS
15	16	dung	His skin was of a rich flower-pot red from sun and wind.	MOS
378	379	phazarika	This I was positive of, for our powers of orientation are often tested in this way in the air service.	NMOS
341	342	phazarika	At the doorway I half turned to glance back at the girl.	NMOS
985	986	ppromthaww	So were his brothers and sisters.	NMOS
616	617	jtopa	She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.	NMOS
375	376	phazarika	He laughed a nasty laugh.	NMOS
317	318	phazarika	I had witnessed my first lunar electrical storm, and I did not wonder that the inhabitants of this strange world were terrified by it.	NMOS
170	171	dung	There was plenty for him to do, and admirably the faithful fellow did it.	NMOS
984	985	ppromthaww	He was a fierce little cub.	NMOS
551	552	tranguyen	Tastes differ, murmured the dragonette, slowly drooping its scaley eyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons.	MOS
193	194	dung	From the utter silence there emerged a deep, regular pat-pat.	NMOS
905	906	ppromthaww	To those that survived it was not tragedy, but realisation and achievement.	NMOS
500	501	tranguyen	Old! Why, I feel like a colt today, replied Jim.	MOS
931	932	ppromthaww	Though he lay down in the entrance and slept, his sleep was fitful.	NMOS
316	317	phazarika	The breaking of camp was a wonderfully simple operation.	NMOS
895	896	ppromthaww	Behind every steel-like contraction of a muscle, lay another steel-like contraction, and another, and another, apparently without end.	MOS
970	971	ppromthaww	It had managed to roll up in a ball again, but it was not quite the old compact ball; its muscles were too much torn for that.	MOS
806	807	ppromthaww	A second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness.	MOS
55	56	dung	There is the evidence of two frightened women that it perched upon the roof of the Queen's Hall and remained there like a diabolical statue for some hours.	MOS
866	867	ppromthaww	Flinging his brands at the nearest of his enemies, the man thrust his smouldering mittens into the snow and stamped about to cool his feet.	NMOS
374	375	phazarika	He made a wry face at that.	NMOS
360	361	phazarika	I can assure you that my sensations were far from pleasurable as I looked over into that awful abyss.	NMOS
0	1	dung	He had swung round his revolving chair so as to face me, and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bull-frog, his head laid back and his eyes half-covered by supercilious lids.	MOS
801	802	ppromthaww	The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness.	NMOS
520	521	tranguyen	The group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered near the stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evil eyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land.	NMOS
880	881	ppromthaww	She dropped in alongside by him, as though it were her appointed position, and took the pace of the pack.	MOS
280	281	phazarika	I looked upon him as scum.	MOS
935	936	ppromthaww	Life was stirring.	NMOS
886	887	ppromthaww	Had there been food, love-making and fighting would have gone on apace, and the pack-formation would have been broken up.	NMOS
608	609	jtopa	She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.	MOS
37	38	dung	I'm like an old golf-ball—I've had all the white paint knocked off me long ago.	MOS
97	98	dung	It was as ear-splitting as any whistle of a railway-engine; but whereas the whistle is a clear, mechanical, sharp-edged sound, this was far deeper in volume and vibrant with the uttermost strain of agony and horror.	MOS
829	830	ppromthaww	Henry rolled over angrily on his side, but was surprised that Bill made no similar display of temper. 	NMOS
71	72	dung	Now he was pale and wild-eyed, gasping as he breathed like one who has run far and fast.	MOS
495	496	tranguyen	The huge forms of these monarchs of the forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutest heart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them.	NMOS
969	970	ppromthaww	The porcupine met his approach with a furious squealing and a clashing of its long teeth.	NMOS
422	423	tranguyen	His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.	NMOS
836	837	ppromthaww	Taking the sled as the centre of the circle that One Ear was making, Bill planned to tap that circle at a point in advance of the pursuit. 	NMOS
400	401	phazarika	It was man against man, now, and the odds were even.	NMOS
583	584	tranguyen	The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of glass were lying scattered in every direction.	NMOS
443	444	tranguyen	"They look like doorways, said Dorothy; ""only there are no stairs to get to them."""	MOS
451	452	tranguyen	The sides of the tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, and the floor became more level.	MOS
586	587	tranguyen	He reached the edge of the tall roof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmly as if he were on firm ground.	MOS
982	983	ppromthaww	He was the one little grey cub of the litter.	NMOS
884	885	ppromthaww	At such times he betrayed no anger.	NMOS
120	121	dung	There was a full-page picture of the most extraordinary creature that I had ever seen.	NMOS
23	24	dung	With these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn Austin, who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our short interview, and I was conducted to the end of the passage.	MOS
243	244	phazarika	About twenty-six hours after we entered the mouth of the crater at the surface of the Moon we suddenly emerged from its opposite end to look upon a scene that was as marvelous and weird, by comparison with the landscape upon the surface of the Moon, as the latter was in comparison with that of our own Earth.	MOS
221	222	phazarika	He was a very large man and when he was angry he looked quite fierce, as he had large mustaches which he brushed upward on either side of his nose—like the tusks of one of his boars.	MOS
473	474	tranguyen	Even these revolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies, and after that we will be at their mercy.	NMOS
279	280	phazarika	Once again I spurred in the direction of the tents of the Or-tis, above which floated the red banners of the Kalkars, around which were massed the flower of the Kalkar forces; too thickly massed, perhaps, for most effective defense, since we were driving them in from three sides and packing them there as tightly as eggs in the belly of a she-salmon.	MOS
224	225	phazarika	He went down like a felled ox and the people scattered like frightened rabbits.	MOS
207	208	phazarika	The bullet struck him square between the eyes, and he dropped like a log, without a sound.	MOS
669	670	jtopa	It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.	MOS
419	420	tranguyen	The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent that one could look through the walls as easily as though a window.	MOS
404	405	tranguyen	Then the boy cracked his whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.	NMOS
340	341	phazarika	Behind him were three others.	NMOS
432	433	tranguyen	"Now, said the little man, ""I will create something out of nothing."""	NMOS
260	261	phazarika	A mighty cruiser vibrant with life and power might sail majestically to engage the flag ship of the Kalkars, when, as by magic, every aluminum part of the cruiser would vanish as mist before the sun, and as nearly ninety percent of a Peace Fleet cruiser, including the hull, was constructed of aluminum, the result may be imagined—one moment there was a great ship forging through the air, her flags and pennants flying in the wind, her band playing, her officers and men at their quarters—the next a mass of engines, polished wood, cordage, flags and human beings hurtling earthward to extinction.	MOS
486	487	tranguyen	The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly, and welcomed with joy the return of the little old Wizard.	NMOS
127	128	dung	He listened with a sceptical smile on his gaunt face, and roared with laughter on hearing that the Professor had convinced me.	NMOS
138	139	dung	Though in his sixty-sixth year, I have never heard him express any dissatisfaction at the occasional hardships which we have had to encounter.	NMOS
277	278	phazarika	It was a massive door, such as the ancients built in their great public buildings, such as this had originally been, and I doubted my ability to force it.	MOS
160	161	dung	At a rough guess the gulf was forty feet across, but, so far as I could see, it might as well have been forty miles.	NMOS
940	941	ppromthaww	It was a jealous note, and he was very careful in keeping a respectful distance.	NMOS
386	387	phazarika	Our position looked almost hopeless.	NMOS
29	30	dung	The Professor snorted like an angry buffalo.	MOS
47	48	dung	Their huge, membranous wings were closed by folding their fore-arms, so that they sat like gigantic old women, wrapped in hideous web-colored shawls, and with their ferocious heads protruding above them.	MOS
246	247	phazarika	And now, they commenced to circle us at a run, much as the savage Indians of the western plains circled the parked wagon trains of our long-gone ancestors in North America.	NMOS
199	200	dung	This we see has not been so.	NMOS
176	177	dung	An enormous three-toed track was imprinted in the soft mud before us.	NMOS
781	782	jtopa	It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.	NMOS
883	884	ppromthaww	Nor was she above slashing his shoulder sharply on occasion.	NMOS
854	855	ppromthaww	He awoke with a start.	NMOS
123	124	dung	The sketch, the photographs, the narrative, and now the actual specimen—the evidence was complete.	NMOS
416	417	tranguyen	We are somewhere in the middle of the earth, and the chances are we'll reach the other side of it before long. But it's a big hollow, isn't it?	MOS
899	900	ppromthaww	The wolves were now in the country of game, and though they still hunted in pack, they hunted more cautiously, cutting out heavy cows or crippled old bulls from the small moose-herds they ran across.	MOS
647	648	jtopa	But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.	MOS
859	860	ppromthaww	There was a great snarling and yelping.	NMOS
363	364	phazarika	We had crossed the cave and were standing between the openings of the two divergent passageways.	NMOS
489	490	tranguyen	In the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walk and try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly through the handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace, wherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse.	NMOS
145	146	dung	You are in safe hands.	NMOS
595	596	tranguyen	There were no privates in the army because all were so courageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one until there were no privates left. 	NMOS
3	4	dung	There was a tap at a door, a bull's bellow from within, and I was face to face with the Professor.	MOS
394	395	phazarika	She nodded coldly in acknowledgment of the presentation and then let her eyes pass above my head toward the opposite end of the throne room.	NMOS
882	883	ppromthaww	On the contrary, he seemed kindly disposed toward her—too kindly to suit her, for he was prone to run near to her, and when he ran too near it was she who snarled and showed her teeth.	NMOS
309	310	phazarika	As we came to understand them and the conditions under which they lived, many things concerning them were explained.	NMOS
414	415	tranguyen	Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close beside them.	NMOS
855	856	ppromthaww	The she-wolf was less than a yard from him.	NMOS
737	738	jtopa	There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.	NMOS
779	780	jtopa	She was prepared for all of these.	NMOS
857	858	ppromthaww	She sprang away, yelling with pain, and while he took delight in the smell of burning flesh and hair, he watched her shaking her head and growling wrathfully a score of feet away.	NMOS
477	478	tranguyen	The creatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for such a dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all the history of their wooden land.	NMOS
457	458	tranguyen	The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to granite.	NMOS
275	276	phazarika	It was a sad occasion for poor Mother, leaving thus her home and those dear neighbors who had been as close to her as her own people; but she was as brave as Juana, nor once did either of them attempt to dissuade me from the wild scheme I had outlined to them.	MOS
527	528	tranguyen	When the next company of Gargoyles advanced, our adventurers began yelling as if they had gone mad.	NMOS
144	145	dung	Even now I can't for the life of me understand why you should have worked it in so extraordinary a manner.	NMOS
25	26	dung	He sprang to his feet, waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic.	MOS
893	894	ppromthaww	Nevertheless, with the exception of the ones that limped, the movements of the animals were effortless and tireless.	NMOS
122	123	dung	An unkind critic might easily have misinterpreted that dim surface.	NMOS
16	17	dung	He seemed an uppish old bird.	MOS
184	185	dung	Our professors would gladly have stayed there all day, so entranced were they by this opportunity of studying the life of a prehistoric age.	NMOS
937	938	ppromthaww	His mate warned him irritably away, and he curled up and slept in the entrance.	NMOS
72	73	dung	It was of enormous size and power, like an erect elephant, but its movements, in spite of its bulk, were exceedingly alert.	MOS
622	623	jtopa	His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.	MOS
238	239	phazarika	Her tones were rich and mellow and her eyes intoxicated me like old wine.	MOS
31	32	dung	The whole great audience seethed and simmered like a boiling pot.	MOS
604	605	jtopa	The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.	MOS
714	715	jtopa	The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.	NMOS
230	231	phazarika	It was the Kalkars—the entire body of them—and they rode straight for us, not swiftly, for the corpse-strewn, slippery ground prevented that; but steadily, overwhelmingly, like a great, slow-moving river of men and horses.	MOS
181	182	dung	I had the same feeling of mystery and danger around us.	NMOS
990	991	ppromthaww	He now saw it again; but it had taken upon itself a remarkable remoteness.	NMOS
165	166	dung	But all was quiet, save that a strange, many-colored bird flew up from under his feet and vanished among the trees.	NMOS
602	603	jtopa	Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.	MOS
792	793	jtopa	Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly	NMOS
687	688	jtopa	They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.	MOS
689	690	jtopa	Music seemed to her the employment of a child.	MOS
27	28	dung	She barred her husband's way like an enraged chicken in front of a bulldog.	MOS
167	168	dung	And there we were, the four of us, upon the dreamland, the lost world, of Maple White.	NMOS
516	517	tranguyen	The Princess served delicious refreshments to those who were in the habit of eating, and when Dorothy's bed time arrived the company separated after exchanging many friendly sentiments.	NMOS
732	733	jtopa	Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr. Eager was restored.	NMOS
153	154	dung	A number of lamps shining through tinted shades bathed the whole great room before us in a ruddy radiance.	NMOS
168	169	dung	For a moment this explanation was in all our minds.	NMOS
594	595	tranguyen	Just behind the royal standard-bearers came the Princess Ozma in her royal chariot, which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamonds set in exquisite designs.	NMOS
615	616	jtopa	On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.	MOS
424	425	tranguyen	There was not an ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not especially pleased by the appearance of these people because their features had no more expression than the faces of dolls.	NMOS
911	912	ppromthaww	And he, for all his grey years and sage experience, behaved quite as puppyishly and even a little more foolishly.	MOS
22	23	dung	Began to tell his adventures in a vague way, but somebody started to pick holes, and he just shut up like an oyster.	MOS
968	969	ppromthaww	He walked as delicately as though all the snow were carpeted with porcupine quills, erect and ready to pierce the soft pads of his feet. 	MOS
471	472	tranguyen	These birds were of enormous size, and reminded Zeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights.	NMOS
214	215	phazarika	Then we wheeled and ran like deer along the winding passageway.	MOS
667	668	jtopa	“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.	MOS
655	656	jtopa	“Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.	NMOS
192	193	dung	Then it shut off as suddenly as it began.	NMOS
528	529	tranguyen	This daunted the enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out of breath.	NMOS
163	164	dung	Under his direction I cut such gashes in the sides of the trees as would ensure that it should fall as we desired.	NMOS
540	541	tranguyen	The watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared, his arms now full of the wooden wings.	NMOS
635	636	jtopa	no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.”	MOS
691	692	jtopa	If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.	MOS
740	741	jtopa	Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.	NMOS
65	66	dung	In front there stood a small group of Indians—little, clean-limbed, red fellows, whose skins glowed like polished bronze in the strong sunlight.	MOS
757	758	jtopa	I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.	NMOS
298	299	phazarika	How recently it had been used we could scarcely estimate, but the trail itself gave every indication of being a very old one.	NMOS
269	270	phazarika	He looked at us as a man might look at carrion; and he gave us no greeting, which suited us perfectly.	MOS
649	650	jtopa	while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.	MOS
654	655	jtopa	Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food	MOS
474	475	tranguyen	But as soon as the conversation ceased the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock and flew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out before them like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats.	MOS
623	624	jtopa	But here you are as safe as in England.	NMOS
64	65	dung	His thin figure and long limbs struggled and fluttered like a chicken being dragged from a coop.	MOS
253	254	phazarika	We will join the others at the tables now,” he said, and as he led the way from the apartment in which we had been conversing alone, stone doors opened before us as by magic, indicating that the Jemadar of Laythe was not only well served, but well protected, or possibly well spied upon.	MOS
172	173	dung	In its shade we continued our discussion, while Lord John, who had quickly taken command in the hour of action, gave us his views.	NMOS
976	977	ppromthaww	Then he returned and took up his burden.	MOS
412	413	tranguyen	Also, turning her head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until now remained as still and silent as she herself.	NMOS
169	170	dung	There was a single crack of his rifle, and, though we saw nothing, we heard the scream and then the distant thud of the falling body.	NMOS
645	646	jtopa	Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.	NMOS
593	594	tranguyen	The procession was very imposing.	NMOS
796	797	jtopa	For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.	NMOS
684	685	jtopa	Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.	MOS
485	486	tranguyen	Indeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow, to hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see her again.	NMOS
67	68	dung	They tied us up—the fellow who handled me could tie like a bosun—and there we lay with our toes up, beneath a tree, while a great brute stood guard over us with a club in his hand.	MOS
201	202	phazarika	Perchance the little area of their activities was never actually encroached upon by the iron-shod hoof of battle; but always somewhere war endured, now receding like the salt tide only to return again; until there arose that great tidal wave of human emotion in 1959 that swept the entire world for eight bloody years, and receding, left peace upon a spent and devastated world.	MOS
845	846	ppromthaww	Never had he been so fond of this body of his as now when his tenure of it was so precarious.	MOS
295	296	phazarika	Above us were banks of fleecy clouds, the undersurfaces of which appeared to be lighted from beneath, while, through breaks in the cloud banks we could discern a luminous firmament beyond, though nowhere was there any suggestion of a central incandescent orb radiating light and heat as does our sun.	MOS
956	957	ppromthaww	In that instant the lynx struck.	NMOS
664	665	jtopa	And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.	MOS
299	300	phazarika	About the barrel of each was a surcingle and connected with it by a backstrap was something analogous to a breeching in Earth horse harness.	MOS
447	448	tranguyen	They saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and twisting around like a nest of great snakes.	MOS
458	459	tranguyen	Presently they came to a low plant which had broad, spreading leaves, in the center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach.	NMOS
894	895	ppromthaww	Their stringy muscles seemed founts of inexhaustible energy.	NMOS
927	928	ppromthaww	One Eye caught sight of a dim movement of white in the midst of the white.	NMOS
296	297	phazarika	Now, however, with a habitable world beneath our feet, surrounded by conditions almost identical with those which existed upon Earth, our future looked less dark, and because of this I found myself in a quandary as to what course of action to pursue in the matter of Orthis’ punishment.	MOS
389	390	phazarika	They believe that there is no reincarnation for those who fall into a crater.	NMOS
438	439	tranguyen	On the central stalk stood poised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so lovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought she had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life.	NMOS
618	619	jtopa	It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.	NMOS
228	229	phazarika	They have strange legends of a far time when great horses of iron raced across the desert dragging iron tents filled with people behind them, and they point to holes in the mountain sides through which these iron monsters made their way to the green valleys by the sea, and they tell of men who flew like birds and as swiftly, but of course we know that such things were never true and are but the stories that the old men and the women among them told to the children for their amusement.

399	400	phazarika	I am no novice with the sword.	NMOS
688	689	jtopa	The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.”	MOS
75	76	dung	A huge deer, with branching horns, a magnificent creature which carried itself like a king, came down with its doe and two fawns and drank beside the armadillos.	MOS
121	122	dung	It was about six inches long, and thicker than my thumb, with some indications of dried cartilage at one end of it.	NMOS
588	589	tranguyen	Dorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let it rest in the air a little over the edge of the roof.	NMOS
445	446	tranguyen	"I don't like these veg'table people, said the little girl. ""They're cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness."""	MOS
768	769	jtopa	The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.	NMOS
236	237	phazarika	Then you are not twenty-five thousand now, and the Kalkars are like ants.	MOS
585	586	tranguyen	His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.	NMOS
38	39	dung	At dawn and at sunset the howler monkeys screamed together and the parrakeets broke into shrill chatter, but during the hot hours of the day only the full drone of insects, like the beat of a distant surf, filled the ear, while nothing moved amid the solemn vistas of stupendous trunks, fading away into the darkness which held us in.	MOS
206	207	phazarika	The faces were very broad, much broader than any human faces that I have ever seen, but their profiles were singularly like those of the ancient North American Indians.	MOS
749	750	jtopa	And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.	NMOS
548	549	tranguyen	The cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to the ground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being always side by side.	NMOS
605	606	jtopa	They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.	MOS
11	12	dung	His smile of benevolence was a wonderful thing, when his cheeks would suddenly bunch into two red apples, between his half-closed eyes and his great black beard.	MOS
504	505	tranguyen	An instant later the Tiger crouched and launched its huge body through the air swift and resistless as a ball from a cannon.	MOS
406	407	tranguyen	He was not going very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and at times he would tremble like a leaf.	MOS
783	784	jtopa	So the grittiness went out of life.	NMOS
84	85	dung	For one moment I had a vision of a horrible mask like a giant toad's, of a warty, leprous skin, and of a loose mouth all beslobbered with fresh blood.	MOS
681	682	jtopa	On another day, when the whole world was singing and the thin air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room 	MOS
690	691	jtopa	He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.	MOS
614	615	jtopa	He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.	NMOS
512	513	tranguyen	'To eat is sweet When hunger's seat Demands a treat Of savory meat.'	MOS
824	825	ppromthaww	Henry nodded his consent.	NMOS
881	882	ppromthaww	He did not snarl at her, nor show his teeth, when any leap of hers chanced to put her in advance of him.	NMOS
30	31	dung	No, sir, no! shouted the accused, and disappeared like a jack-in-the-box.	MOS
903	904	ppromthaww	And all the while the she-wolf sat on her haunches and smiled.	NMOS
715	716	jtopa	There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.	NMOS
598	599	tranguyen	In the afternoon they all went to a great field outside the city gates where the games were to be held.	NMOS
658	659	jtopa	During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully	MOS
744	745	jtopa	Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.	NMOS
436	437	tranguyen	There were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them, but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do.	NMOS
913	914	ppromthaww	Forgotten, save once, when old One Eye stopped for a moment to lick his stiffening wounds.	MOS
943	944	ppromthaww	It was not the first time in his long and successful life that this thing had happened.	NMOS
225	226	phazarika	The lad shuffled his feet and caught his breath—it was like a stifled sob.	MOS
463	464	tranguyen	The top of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it you will be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live.	NMOS
889	890	ppromthaww	It ran below its ordinary speed.	NMOS
446	447	tranguyen	When he lighted the oil a hundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.	MOS
573	574	tranguyen	The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an umbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear.	MOS
832	833	ppromthaww	And there, out in the snow of their back track, was the she-wolf waiting for him.	NMOS
823	824	ppromthaww	The dominant colour was grey, and yet there was to it a faint reddish hue—a hue that was baffling, that appeared and disappeared, that was more like an illusion of the vision, now grey, distinctly grey, and again giving hints and glints of a vague redness of colour not classifiable in terms of ordinary experience.	MOS
564	565	tranguyen	The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and did not look very inviting.	NMOS
301	302	phazarika	For a moment we stood there eyeing each other, and from their appearance I judged that they were as much interested in us as we were in them.	NMOS
441	442	tranguyen	"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives, continued the Prince, with a sigh, ""that while we are in our full prime we must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sprout and grow and give birth to other people."""	MOS
742	743	jtopa	He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.	NMOS
366	367	phazarika	He carried a knife slung in a scabbard depending from a shoulder belt, and in his right hand he grasped a slender lance.	NMOS
